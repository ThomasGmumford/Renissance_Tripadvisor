The gym is good. The only shortfall is the concierge lounge is a bit light. All in all if you can afford it this is a great hotel.

Beautiful fountain in the lounge area string lights made you want to have a drink and relax. Staff (I wish I remembered names) were extremely friendly and so helpful. My husband travels stays with Marriott always this was my favorite out of all so far! It's convenient to many restaurants and a few malls just walking distance.,Jodmaine,Portland,,7 reviews,Stayed May 2016 travelled with family

However the bed linens are not up to the quality of the Marriott brand. Whomever is making the bed needs some training.

We have a 6 month old and a three year old. We had a room with two beds. With the pack and play it was a little tight. The room is a bit small. Next time we will likely book a suite. The hotel is very trendily decorated but had everything we needed. The service was great the room was very clean the location is safe and within walking distance to the mall and restaurants. In fact we walked to the mall and restaurants for a night out with the kids. It's a great area and a great mall. We had an especially memorable moment with one of the doormen. He was helping us load our bags in the car. The three year old was climbing into the car. I was distracted for a second loading in a bag and the doorman ran up to her door to make sure she got in the car ok. Very thoughtful. Although the trendy look of the lobby feels more like a nightclub than a family friendly hotel the cleanliness friendly staff and location will make this a regular hotel that we will return to when staying in Charlotte.,adempsey21,Nashville Tennessee,,18 reviews,Stayed April 2016 travelled with family

Everything was paid by them. On arrival I was asked to produce a credit card for incidentals. They were going to hold $50 a night(3). I don't have a credit card. They were not going to let me have a room!!! After the front desk and I had a few words a call was made... I was made to feel inferior in front of strangers... My company paid over 200 per night plus paid for 3 meals per day for over 20 people. I will never stay there again or recommend to anyone. The only saving grace for them are Regina who took care of us every morning and lunch.... She is golden!!!! Also Cat in the bar!!! 2 great employees!!!

This trip was an east coast college tour trip with our daughter. Being familiar with the property though we haven't stayed here in years decided to stay again. First who offers rooms with two beds but they are doubles??? instead of queens in this day and age? Yikes I am sure Marriott has upgraded their mattresses why not bump up the size of the beds. I didn't even think to ask as I have not encountered any other Marriott property in years that still has doubles at any level. Also the decor is hip but I know for a fact the last time it was updated and carpet redone was at least 8 years ago because that is when we were last at HHI and I actually have photos on my computer of my 8 year old daughter in the rooms on that trip. And she is 16 now. We had been on the road all day and were not about to pay for two rooms to have reasonably sized beds. And we are average to skinny people. Just get with it Marriott and put two queens in the rooms - there is room for it. Indoor pool is nice and lobby is nice with lots of smaller sitting areas next to bar and restaurant. Saw no one eating in restaurant. Breakfast is very expensive there and there are lots of options in the area. You are directly across from the Southpark Mall which has everything you can think of - upscale stores and mid range and a huge food court. Plus lots of other cool areas in this part of Charlotte with lots of newer restaurants and shops within 5 min drive of hotel. Other than that hotel is in business building type of area with a surface parking lot or parking garage attached if they are very busy with weddings etc as can happen on weekends. Bathroom was average - no ventilation in there nothing special. To aid in the efficiency of us getting up and on the road for our next tour the next day I went down to the gym locker room to get ready and do makeup. Yikes -very severe lighting in there and not suitable for much of anything. We ate in Davidson at North Harbor Cafe which was beautiful on Lake Norman and so nice to eat outside on their big deck overlooking the harbor. But they are very expensive and the portions are tiny. tiny. Place used to be very nice casual with great food and portions but seems they are charging for their location. They even charge you for bread and bring out two pieces. I have heard Kindred is great in that area and Toast. Will have to try next time. Charlotte is loaded with cool new places to eat very close to the Renaissance so give those a try. Club lounge level of hotel was in a conference room on first floor because they were cleaning several floors carpeting and had the true club levels closed down for that reason.,bonevoyage,Avon Lake,,38 reviews,Stayed April 2016 travelled with family

We couldn't have selected a more perfect spot to stay. We were just minutes from the golf course and right across the street from South Park Mall. The room was beautiful decor was soothing. We loved everything about the hotel and employees. We ate breakfast twice and it was delicious! Highly recommend this hotel ( even though it's a little pricey)!!! I do wish since the price was so high we would have had free Wifi.,Mary Jo C,Brooklyn,Room Tip: We were on the second floor...our room overlooked part of the atrium and fountain.

I have been through the Charlotte airport a million times but never actually stayed in Charlotte before. This time however I had a business meeting in Charlotte and booked a room at the Renaissance SouthPark Hotel in Charlotte. Let me tell you besides just the beauty of this property the staff is 2nd to none. EVERYONE treats you like you were a presidential guest. Everyone. No matter what you want. And above all that is a guy by the name of Danny. Danny greets you at the front door with the most genuine and biggest smile you have ever seen. He is just awesome. Want your car? No problem. Want some directions? No problem. Want some advice on what to do or restaurants no problem. Danny knows it all. Want to just simply chat with a super and genuinely nice person? No problem. He seems to know everyone and everything about Charlotte. Renaissance Charlotte . . . You need to hang onto this guy. He is just awesome. Thanks for a GREAT stay and experience during a tense business trip. Rest assured I will absolutely stay at this location again. If you happen to stay at this place meet Danny and tell him Tim from Chicago sent you. You WILL be taken care of.,Timothy H,Auburn Hills MI United States,Room Tip: High floor on the club level See more room tips,2 reviews,Stayed May 2016 travelled on business

The bed is so comfortable I did not want to get out of the it. The entire hotel decor is quite chic. The courtyard looks like something from a five star resort there are two fire pits and a beautiful large tree that towers over the entire courtyard with very comfy seating and a few rocking chairs. The courtyard is quite beautiful. Danny the valet guy has a really friendly personality. He smiled the entire time and got the hotel door for me and said if he could do anything to make my stay better let him know. He truly set the tone for my stay. I'm not sure if I've ever met such a friendly valet guy in my life. I ate at the restaurant and Tim Prather and Morgan White were very helpful with helping make my food and wine selections. Morgan is really knowledgeable about wine. They enjoyed helping me every step of the way I was so indecisive. I highly recommend this hotel! It seems as though everyone really takes pride in their job and desires to make you happy and comfortable!,robertastowers,Florida,,1 review,Stayed May 2016 travelled solo

It is pricey and right in the middle of everything. The rooms were large and clean. Wish they would have included free internet in the room but I notice that the pricer hotels all seem to do this. Great restaurants walking distance. Cheesecake Factory Smith and Wolensky steps away. Great mall to walk after dinner. My brother and I enjoyed just looking at all the beautiful stores. Tiffany LVNordstrom and all their friends have large beautiful window displays. How many malls have a Maserati parked inside for purchase? The hotel has valet parking and self parking. I chose self park and had no trouble finding one but it was earlier in the day. Access from the garage to the lobby made self park a lot easier.,daisy4202016,Savannah Georgia,,4 reviews,Stayed May 2016

Fare noted below. It was swift and we were lucky to receive an early checkin. We were part of a wedding group. The wedding was Saturday at 5 pm in a beautiful courtyard. A cocktail reception followed. A delicious dinner festivities and dancing were delightful. We took the elevator back to the room! The beds are very nice with top of the line sheets. We slept soundly here for two nights. The hotel is in the Southpark mall area and streets are tree-lined. There are many places to walk shop relax and dine in the area. The location the friendly service and the seamless process made this a five star weekend for us. Sunday we dined in the restaurant (ordered from menu vs. buffet option - thanks for having this!) for breakfast. Again we received sincere and timely service. A cab was waiting as we departed. A friendly bellman helped us get into the cab. We returned to the airport in time to check in before crowds appeared. The cab ride was about 37.00 each way with tip. At this location there is absolutely no need to rent a car. I would recommend the hotel for groups and occasions like this. The staff is professional and take their goals and guest services seriously.,Travelartgolf,Santa Rosa Beach Florida,,304 reviews,Stayed May 2016 travelled as a couple

My trip was for a family gathering on site so I cannot say a great deal about the location other than to say it is quite close to a large number of shops and restaurants and not very far from the airport at all. My bed had seen better days but I otherwise found my room clean and comfortable. The breakfast buffet is only a bit better than average and overpriced at $20. I was quite satisfied overall. If this location works for your visit to Charlotte this is a very good place to stay.,ClayC1969,Des Plaines Illinois,,55 reviews,Stayed March 2016 travelled with family

Once we got to our room we found it very noisy. We called the front desk and they offered to change our room which we did. Definitely a good choice for peace and quiet. Why the 3-star rating ... This is supposed to be a 4 star property so I would expect cleanliness to be a top priority. All the vents in the room were caked with dust as was the hair dryer. The design of the bathroom was strange - the toilet paper holder and the towel rack were on the sink "apron" so you couldn't stand near the sink. The clock lost 2 hours every day. Overall they neglected the details that would elevate this to 4-stars.,MumaRules,Massachusetts,,53 reviews,Stayed February 2016 travelled as a couple

Plus lots of other cool areas in this part of Charlotte with lots of newer restaurants and shops within 5 min drive of hotel. Other than that hotel is in business building type of area with a surface parking lot or parking garage attached if they are very busy with weddings etc as can happen on weekends. Bathroom was average - no ventilation in there nothing special. To aid in the efficiency of us getting up and on the road for our next tour the next day I went down to the gym locker room to get ready and do makeup. Yikes -very severe lighting in there and not suitable for much of anything. We ate in Davidson at North Harbor Cafe which was beautiful on Lake Norman and so nice to eat outside on their big deck overlooking the harbor. But they are very expensive and the portions are tiny. tiny. Place used to be very nice casual with great food and portions but seems they are charging for their location. They even charge you for bread and bring out two pieces. I have heard Kindred is great in that area and Toast. Will have to try next time. Charlotte is loaded with cool new places to eat very close to the Renaissance so give those a try. Club lounge level of hotel was in a conference room on first floor because they were cleaning several floors carpeting and had the true club levels closed down for that reason.,bonevoyage,Avon Lake,,38 reviews,Stayed April 2016 travelled with family

We have a 6 month old and a three year old. We had a room with two beds. With the pack and play it was a little tight. The room is a bit small. Next time we will likely book a suite. The hotel is very trendily decorated but had everything we needed. The service was great the room was very clean the location is safe and within walking distance to the mall and restaurants. In fact we walked to the mall and restaurants for a night out with the kids. It's a great area and a great mall. We had an especially memorable moment with one of the doormen. He was helping us load our bags in the car. The three year old was climbing into the car. I was distracted for a second loading in a bag and the doorman ran up to her door to make sure she got in the car ok. Very thoughtful.

This trip was an east coast college tour trip with our daughter. Being familiar with the property though we haven't stayed here in years decided to stay again. First who offers rooms with two beds but they are doubles??? instead of queens in this day and age? Yikes I am sure Marriott has upgraded their mattresses why not bump up the size of the beds. I didn't even think to ask as I have not encountered any other Marriott property in years that still has doubles at any level. Also the decor is hip but I know for a fact the last time it was updated and carpet redone was at least 8 years ago because that is when we were last at HHI and I actually have photos on my computer of my 8 year old daughter in the rooms on that trip. And she is 16 now. We had been on the road all day and were not about to pay for two rooms to have reasonably sized beds. And we are average to skinny people. Just get with it Marriott and put two queens in the rooms - there is room for it. Indoor pool is nice and lobby is nice with lots of smaller sitting areas next to bar and restaurant. Saw no one eating in restaurant. Breakfast is very expensive there and there are lots of options in the area.

I have been through the Charlotte airport a million times but never actually stayed in Charlotte before. This time however I had a business meeting in Charlotte and booked a room at the Renaissance SouthPark Hotel in Charlotte. Let me tell you besides just the beauty of this property the staff is 2nd to none. EVERYONE treats you like you were a presidential guest. Everyone. No matter what you want. And above all that is a guy by the name of Danny. Danny greets you at the front door with the most genuine and biggest smile you have ever seen. He is just awesome. Want your car? No problem. Want some directions? No problem. Want some advice on what to do or restaurants no problem. Danny knows it all. Want to just simply chat with a super and genuinely nice person? No problem. He seems to know everyone and everything about Charlotte. Renaissance Charlotte . . . You need to hang onto this guy. He is just awesome. Thanks for a GREAT stay and experience during a tense business trip. Rest assured I will absolutely stay at this location again.

The bed is so comfortable I did not want to get out of the it. The entire hotel decor is quite chic. The courtyard looks like something from a five star resort there are two fire pits and a beautiful large tree that towers over the entire courtyard with very comfy seating and a few rocking chairs. The courtyard is quite beautiful. Danny the valet guy has a really friendly personality. He smiled the entire time and got the hotel door for me and said if he could do anything to make my stay better let him know. He truly set the tone for my stay. I'm not sure if I've ever met such a friendly valet guy in my life. I ate at the restaurant and Tim Prather and Morgan White were very helpful with helping make my food and wine selections. Morgan is really knowledgeable about wine. They enjoyed helping me every step of the way I was so indecisive. I highly recommend this hotel!

The hotel was extremely accommodating and many shared amenities in the lobby bar and restaurant were updated and very appealing. The meeting rooms them self could have used some updating and much more ergonomic chairs after being there for a week.

This trip was an east coast college tour trip with our daughter. Being familiar with the property though we haven't stayed here in years decided to stay again. First who offers rooms with two beds but they are doubles??? instead of queens in this day and age? Yikes I am sure Marriott has upgraded their mattresses why not bump up the size of the beds. I didn't even think to ask as I have not encountered any other Marriott property in years that still has doubles at any level. Also the decor is hip but I know for a fact the last time it was updated and carpet redone was at least 8 years ago because that is when we were last at HHI and I actually have photos on my computer of my 8 year old daughter in the rooms on that trip. And she is 16 now. We had been on the road all day and were not about to pay for two rooms to have reasonably sized beds. And we are average to skinny people. Just get with it Marriott and put two queens in the rooms - there is room for it. Indoor pool is nice and lobby is nice with lots of smaller sitting areas next to bar and restaurant. Saw no one eating in restaurant. Breakfast is very expensive there and there are lots of options in the area. You are directly across from the Southpark Mall which has everything you can think of - upscale stores and mid range and a huge food court. Plus lots of other cool areas in this part of Charlotte with lots of newer restaurants and shops within 5 min drive of hotel. Other than that hotel is in business building type of area with a surface parking lot or parking garage attached if they are very busy with weddings etc as can happen on weekends. Bathroom was average - no ventilation in there nothing special. To aid in the efficiency of us getting up and on the road for our next tour the next day I went down to the gym locker room to get ready and do makeup. Yikes -very severe lighting in there and not suitable for much of anything. We ate in Davidson at North Harbor Cafe which was beautiful on Lake Norman and so nice to eat outside on their big deck overlooking the harbor. But they are very expensive and the portions are tiny. tiny. Place used to be very nice casual with great food and portions but seems they are charging for their location. They even charge you for bread and bring out two pieces. I have heard Kindred is great in that area and Toast. Will have to try next time. Charlotte is loaded with cool new places to eat very close to the Renaissance so give those a try. Club lounge level of hotel was in a conference room on first floor because they were cleaning several floors carpeting and had the true club levels closed down for that reason.,bonevoyage,Avon Lake,,38 reviews,Stayed April 2016 travelled with family

We have a 6 month old and a three year old. We had a room with two beds. With the pack and play it was a little tight. The room is a bit small. Next time we will likely book a suite. The hotel is very trendily decorated but had everything we needed. The service was great the room was very clean the location is safe and within walking distance to the mall and restaurants. In fact we walked to the mall and restaurants for a night out with the kids. It's a great area and a great mall. We had an especially memorable moment with one of the doormen. He was helping us load our bags in the car. The three year old was climbing into the car. I was distracted for a second loading in a bag and the doorman ran up to her door to make sure she got in the car ok. Very thoughtful. Although the trendy look of the lobby feels more like a nightclub than a family friendly hotel the cleanliness friendly staff and location will make this a regular hotel that we will return to when staying in Charlotte.,adempsey21,Nashville Tennessee,,18 reviews,Stayed April 2016 travelled with family

I ALWAYS make an extra effort to stay at the South Park Renaissance. Why? Clean? Yup. Convenient? Yup. Up to date? Got that too. But it's the staff that make the difference. From check-in to room service to the lobby bar/dining the staff are the best. Sometimes months go by between visits but I am still remembered. I have to shout out to Miri who has recommended dining always remembers me and is always attentive. Newer favs are Kat and Morgan. They too have demonstrated extra effort to make the meal or the drink or the conversation that much more pleasant.

The bed is so comfortable I did not want to get out of the it. The entire hotel decor is quite chic. The courtyard looks like something from a five star resort there are two fire pits and a beautiful large tree that towers over the entire courtyard with very comfy seating and a few rocking chairs. The courtyard is quite beautiful. Danny the valet guy has a really friendly personality. He smiled the entire time and got the hotel door for me and said if he could do anything to make my stay better let him know. He truly set the tone for my stay. I'm not sure if I've ever met such a friendly valet guy in my life. I ate at the restaurant and Tim Prather and Morgan White were very helpful with helping make my food and wine selections. Morgan is really knowledgeable about wine. They enjoyed helping me every step of the way I was so indecisive. I highly recommend this hotel!

It is pricey and right in the middle of everything. The rooms were large and clean. Wish they would have included free internet in the room but I notice that the pricer hotels all seem to do this. Great restaurants walking distance. Cheesecake Factory Smith and Wolensky steps away. Great mall to walk after dinner. My brother and I enjoyed just looking at all the beautiful stores. Tiffany LVNordstrom and all their friends have large beautiful window displays. How many malls have a Maserati parked inside for purchase? The hotel has valet parking and self parking. I chose self park and had no trouble finding one but it was earlier in the day.

Fare noted below. It was swift and we were lucky to receive an early checkin. We were part of a wedding group. The wedding was Saturday at 5 pm in a beautiful courtyard. A cocktail reception followed. A delicious dinner festivities and dancing were delightful. We took the elevator back to the room! The beds are very nice with top of the line sheets. We slept soundly here for two nights. The hotel is in the Southpark mall area and streets are tree-lined. There are many places to walk shop relax and dine in the area. The location the friendly service and the seamless process made this a five star weekend for us. Sunday we dined in the restaurant (ordered from menu vs. buffet option - thanks for having this!) for breakfast. Again we received sincere and timely service. A cab was waiting as we departed. A friendly bellman helped us get into the cab. We returned to the airport in time to check in before crowds appeared. The cab ride was about 37.00 each way with tip. At this location there is absolutely no need to rent a car. I would recommend the hotel for groups and occasions like this.

Beautiful hotel Alan the doorman was very nice. Rooms were beautiful but the refrigerator wouldn't cool. A/c didn't cool we ended up buying a fan for the room. We are vapors and we asked the manager what areas we could go in. We were told by the manager that we could go in the courtyard which was beautiful as long as we didn't vape in the hotel. Which was perfectly fine with us. The first night we hung out in the courtyard and was perfect. Had an amazing book time. Second night we were told to leave the courtyard because they didn't want to cushions to smell and they held up a no smoking sign. Then they brought us to an area that they said was vape friendly and it was in an alley in the back of the hotel wet rained cold furniture. Not worth the good money we paid for this hotel.

The design of the bathroom was strange - the toilet paper holder and the towel rack were on the sink "apron" so you couldn't stand near the sink. The clock lost 2 hours every day. Overall they neglected the details that would elevate this to 4-stars.,MumaRules,Massachusetts,,53 reviews,Stayed February 2016 travelled as a couple

The hotel is located in an upscale area around shopping and restaurants of many flavors. .The hotel is about 15+ minutes from uptown which is where the ballpark is located. The hotel is clean and spacious. ..Our room was spacious with a queen bed full size pullout and we had a rollaway. The room included a refrigerator and coffee maker. The hotel has a wonderful courtyard area with rocking chairs ect. So relaxing. The pool was okay and they have a sauna which we couldn't get to work. We ate at the on site restaurant which was probably a big mistake. The food was okay and the staff nice but it took forever and I mean forever. They apologized and said they were short staffed but hungry tired kids don't care about that. Plus the cost wasn't worth it. That could have been managed much better. Needless to say we didn't eat there anymore. We also had an issue with our room--they forgot to clean it one day...we accumulate a lot of trash and laundry..so that was frustrating especially since we mentioned getting our room cleaned as we left our room for the day. The area outside of the elevators was great fun for the kids--chairs that allow kids to rock side to side and round about...The good of our stay well outweighed things that could have been better..we will stay again.,TravelingGirl46,Springfield Ohio,,97 reviews,Stayed July 2015 travelled with family

Very helpful staff in the lobby. The majority of the parking area is a little far out from the hotel so be prepared to lug luggage if you don't get help at the door. Great common areas including several lounge areas (both indoors and out) and a bar however the pool area is very small. As for the room it featured clean modern decor though it was not super plush. As usual there was a mini fridge but the living area layout is not as accommodating as a Residence Inn would be for lengthy stays. Ventilation worked well and was not intrusive. The wifi is free for Marriott Rewards guests and it was adequate (didn't attempt streaming). The bed was very nice and soft and there was not a lot of traffic noise from outside. Overall a good stay.

Was very disappointed on several counts. When we arrived the receptionist guy told my wife the pool was heated to 85 degrees only to find out it was well below that in fact it was quite cold and meant you had to keep moving to keep warm. The pool area was very uninviting there was a changing room but it had no lockers so we left our gear on the poolside chairs there is no hot tub steam room & the sauna wasn't working. Most decent hotels have a hot tub as well as a swimming pool. So in our 2 days there we only spent about 15 mins at pool because it was rubbish. When arriving at the hotel expect to be met by one bell boy only most decent hotels have there bell boys instantly at your service as soon as you pull up but don't expect that here. The hotel position is one of the few positives in that it is across the road from a decent shopping mall but even that is ruined because the hotel entrance doesn't have steps directly in front of the entrance so you have to walk all the way around the car park to get to the zebra crossing to the mall. Although we had a car I fancied using the local transportation to get into the uptown part of Charlotte and not drink & drive I did my research before hand to find out there is a bus service to Tivola where you can transfer to a high speed tram. I spotted the bus stop across the road for the direction to the mall but couldn't see the one for other direction I wanted to go so I asked the reception where it was but nobody knew and one guy a different one to the one who told a lie over the pool temperature said it was at the mall. They are clueless because I found it to be across from the pool area. Although the hotel rooms are nice the pool area is a big disappointment so I can only class it as average.,Jim_lad_58,Dorset,,9 reviews,Stayed March 2015 travelled with family

Could not have chosen better. From the moment we drove up we were welcomed like family. Danny helped me park and take my bags upstairs while the desk staff acted as if they were expecting me and had me ready to go without even a credit card swipe! Benefit of being a rewards member I suppose. We found a well-sized corner room outfitted nicely with discretely hidden refrigerator and microwave. We had room-service one morning and highly recommend both the Eggs Benedict and the green friend tomato Eggs Benedict. The staff helped us at every turn from walking directions to cucumber and watermelon water when we returned from our walks. They encouraged us to spend time in the courtyard under the gorgeous tree. We did both during the day and at night by the fire pits. I had not experienced this before: we were offered Marriott points for declining housekeeping AND for declining free breakfast. Love those options! We will return here often!,Klb333,,,250 reviews,Stayed April 2015 travelled as a couple

Tons of amenities - free wifi; workout room w/ free bottled water; Club Lounge that provides free breakfast (eggs bacon yogurt fresh fruit coffee etc.); free spa water and cupcakes in the lobby; bar; restaurant; conference facilities; walking distance to local restaurants and a large shopping mall (Macy's Belk Nordstroms etc.); and taxis are always available. The king bedroom on the 7th floor was clean; quiet; and the bed was comfortable. I was surprised there was no microwave but there is a small refrigerator and coffee maker. Staff was friendly and helpful - even when you ask dumb questions like "Where is the hair dryer?". By the way it's hanging up on the back of the bathroom door. I opted to not have the room made up to receive 500 extra points. I felt completely safe in the area. I walked to the nearby shopping mall and to the local restaurants without any problems. Unfortunately there is no hotel shuttle so be prepared to pay about $35 (includes tip) for a taxi from the airport to the hotel. Check in and check out was fast and easy.

Was very disappointed on several counts. When we arrived the receptionist guy told my wife the pool was heated to 85 degrees only to find out it was well below that in fact it was quite cold and meant you had to keep moving to keep warm. The pool area was very uninviting there was a changing room but it had no lockers so we left our gear on the poolside chairs there is no hot tub steam room & the sauna wasn't working. Most decent hotels have a hot tub as well as a swimming pool. So in our 2 days there we only spent about 15 mins at pool because it was rubbish. When arriving at the hotel expect to be met by one bell boy only most decent hotels have there bell boys instantly at your service as soon as you pull up but don't expect that here. The hotel position is one of the few positives in that it is across the road from a decent shopping mall but even that is ruined because the hotel entrance doesn't have steps directly in front of the entrance so you have to walk all the way around the car park to get to the zebra crossing to the mall. Although we had a car I fancied using the local transportation to get into the uptown part of Charlotte and not drink & drive I did my research before hand to find out there is a bus service to Tivola where you can transfer to a high speed tram. I spotted the bus stop across the road for the direction to the mall but couldn't see the one for other direction I wanted to go so I asked the reception where it was but nobody knew and one guy a different one to the one who told a lie over the pool temperature said it was at the mall. They are clueless because I found it to be across from the pool area. Although the hotel rooms are nice the pool area is a big disappointment so I can only class it as average.,Jim_lad_58,Dorset,,9 reviews,Stayed March 2015 travelled with family

I have to agree he was right the hotel is one of the best Marriott's I have been to. From the check in counter to the chef everything was great. Even though I don't have special status on Marriott the front desk gave me lounge privilege. I have to call out to one of the chef on finding out that I was a vegetarian I was reluctant to eat at the hotel due to limited choice. The chef asked me for my choice and made an excellent dish all vegetarian just for me - off the menu. The hostess and chef took special care to ensure that I was happy with the meal. I would totally recommend this hotel.

The hotel is clean and spacious. ..Our room was spacious with a queen bed full size pullout and we had a rollaway. The room included a refrigerator and coffee maker. The hotel has a wonderful courtyard area with rocking chairs ect. So relaxing. The pool was okay and they have a sauna which we couldn't get to work. We ate at the on site restaurant which was probably a big mistake. The food was okay and the staff nice but it took forever and I mean forever. They apologized and said they were short staffed but hungry tired kids don't care about that. Plus the cost wasn't worth it. That could have been managed much better. Needless to say we didn't eat there anymore. We also had an issue with our room--they forgot to clean it one day...we accumulate a lot of trash and laundry..so that was frustrating especially since we mentioned getting our room cleaned as we left our room for the day. The area outside of the elevators was great fun for the kids--chairs that allow kids to rock side to side and round about...The good of our stay well outweighed things that could have been better..we will stay again.,TravelingGirl46,Springfield Ohio,,97 reviews,Stayed July 2015 travelled with family

Our room was 5th floor spacious and comfy. We enjoyed a full breakfast the next morning as well. But what stood out the most were the employees. From the front desk housekeeping and wait staff. Lauren at the bar? Go by and say hi and have her make you a pineapple upside down cake martini. And last but not forgotten. ..DANNY. this man is Renaissance Charlotte.

Also I do not valet park and he helped us find a very convenient and safe spot to park without having to go in the garage.

This was our second time staying here and we didn't even know they had a pool the first time we visited. A Jacuzzi would be nice but the fitness room and sauna makes up for the lack of a Jacuzzi(I guess). Thanks Renaissance for making my fiancees birthday great!!!

The hotel is located in an upscale area around shopping and restaurants of many flavors. .The hotel is about 15+ minutes from uptown which is where the ballpark is located. The hotel is clean and spacious. ..Our room was spacious with a queen bed full size pullout and we had a rollaway. The room included a refrigerator and coffee maker. The hotel has a wonderful courtyard area with rocking chairs ect. So relaxing. The pool was okay and they have a sauna which we couldn't get to work. We ate at the on site restaurant which was probably a big mistake. The food was okay and the staff nice but it took forever and I mean forever. They apologized and said they were short staffed but hungry tired kids don't care about that. Plus the cost wasn't worth it. That could have been managed much better. Needless to say we didn't eat there anymore. We also had an issue with our room--they forgot to clean it one day...we accumulate a lot of trash and laundry..so that was frustrating especially since we mentioned getting our room cleaned as we left our room for the day. The area outside of the elevators was great fun for the kids--chairs that allow kids to rock side to side and round about...The good of our stay well outweighed things that could have been better..we will stay again.,TravelingGirl46,Springfield Ohio,,97 reviews,Stayed July 2015 travelled with family

The rooms are spacious – and the little touches like plenty of bathroom counter space a wide space in the tub for toiletries extremely comfortable beds Aveda products and even scented hand scrubs the public bathrooms were most welcome! There are a variety of small and large seating areas - some whimsical and some retro. An open outdoor area with a huge tree and other live greenery is the perfect place to kick back and relax anytime during your stay. Fire pits are lit as the weather cools.

Was very disappointed on several counts. When we arrived the receptionist guy told my wife the pool was heated to 85 degrees only to find out it was well below that in fact it was quite cold and meant you had to keep moving to keep warm. The pool area was very uninviting there was a changing room but it had no lockers so we left our gear on the poolside chairs there is no hot tub steam room & the sauna wasn't working. Most decent hotels have a hot tub as well as a swimming pool. So in our 2 days there we only spent about 15 mins at pool because it was rubbish. When arriving at the hotel expect to be met by one bell boy only most decent hotels have there bell boys instantly at your service as soon as you pull up but don't expect that here. The hotel position is one of the few positives in that it is across the road from a decent shopping mall but even that is ruined because the hotel entrance doesn't have steps directly in front of the entrance so you have to walk all the way around the car park to get to the zebra crossing to the mall. Although we had a car I fancied using the local transportation to get into the uptown part of Charlotte and not drink & drive I did my research before hand to find out there is a bus service to Tivola where you can transfer to a high speed tram. I spotted the bus stop across the road for the direction to the mall but couldn't see the one for other direction I wanted to go so I asked the reception where it was but nobody knew and one guy a different one to the one who told a lie over the pool temperature said it was at the mall. They are clueless because I found it to be across from the pool area.

Tons of amenities - free wifi; workout room w/ free bottled water; Club Lounge that provides free breakfast (eggs bacon yogurt fresh fruit coffee etc.); free spa water and cupcakes in the lobby; bar; restaurant; conference facilities; walking distance to local restaurants and a large shopping mall (Macy's Belk Nordstroms etc.); and taxis are always available. The king bedroom on the 7th floor was clean; quiet; and the bed was comfortable. I was surprised there was no microwave but there is a small refrigerator and coffee maker. Staff was friendly and helpful - even when you ask dumb questions like "Where is the hair dryer?". By the way it's hanging up on the back of the bathroom door. I opted to not have the room made up to receive 500 extra points. I felt completely safe in the area. I walked to the nearby shopping mall and to the local restaurants without any problems. Unfortunately there is no hotel shuttle so be prepared to pay about $35 (includes tip) for a taxi from the airport to the hotel. Check in and check out was fast and easy. They seemed happy to accommodate my late check out request as well. Would definitely be happy to stay here again!,Cbug73,Spokane,Room Tip: 7th floor seemed quiet See more room tips,131 reviews,Stayed March 2015 travelled on business

However we were traveling with two children and booked a double queen. When we got there they said that we had a king sized bed - they rolled in two roll in beds but we couldn't walk in the room!

We booked the American Girl/Everything Pink package for our stay. We could not have asked for friendlier more welcoming staff and beautiful accomodations. Our daughter was treated so well from the moment we walked through the doors. The staff was wonderful all weekend even remembering that it was my daughter's birthday and always making sure to talk to her. The room was also perfect my daughter couldn't believe it was all for her! The beds were so comfortable. Breakfast was great with a very nice selection. The indoor pool was warm never crowded. We weren't able to visit the courtyard due to private parties both nights but we had a nice view from our room and it looked very inviting. The mall was just across the street within walking distance. We had a great trip and will definitely stay here again.,Pamela S,Nashville North Carolina,,1 review,Stayed April 2015 travelled with family

After having an unpleasant stay at the Holiday Inn in downtown Charlotte for one night we booked the remainder of our stay at the Renaissance after seeing multiple great reviews on Trip Advisor. They did not steer us wrong. As a Marriott member they checked me in under my account and when I arrived they had already pre-checked me in and had my key ready. I walked up to the counter and they said "Thank you you and here are your room keys.". My check in literally took all of about 20 seconds. It was AWESOME! The room itself was incredibly clean comfortable and quiet. Everything that we have expected to receive from a Renaissance hotel. The staff was courteous and helpful and the overall presentation of the hotel was updated fresh fun and just felt comfortable. No "ick" factor to be found anywhere. The location of the hotel was great. Close to downtown. Quick to get to Carowinds. Close to shopping restaurants and all the things that you would want to get to. If we're in Charlotte again then we're staying here! On a side note...parking is free in the garage. However if you want free wi-fi then you need to be a Mariott rewards member.,FamilyGuyFromIndy,Indianapolis IN,,26 reviews,Stayed April 2015 travelled as a couple

We booked the Everything Pink package and it was worth every penny! From the time we arrived in the parking lot to the time we left the staff made us feel like family. This was our very first American Girl Doll experience so we weren't exactly sure what to expect. I can honestly say these people have it together. When we arrived in the parking lot there was a little construction going on and we weren't sure where to park...but Alan (I believe was his name) met us at our window. We told him we were a little early and we weren't sure if we could check in yet. He said it was perfectly fine. He told us where to park and said he would let the staff know we were there. As we were parking he came back out to our car to let us know that our reservation was ready. He was very thoughtful and kind. As soon as we walked through the front door...our little girl was greeted as if she made the reservation herself. She was taken to her very own "check-in" table for her and her doll Grace. She was even given her very own key to our room. When we walked into our room our daughter had the biggest smile on her face. I knew right then that this trip was gonna be amazing. Our room was very clean and the balcony overlooking the atrium was pretty neat too. The courtyard was beautifully decorated with white lights in the trees surrounded with rocking chairs and fire pits. The hotel is located right across the street from the South Park Mall. A nice sidewalk and red light crossing made it very easy to just walk across the street. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the mall as well and it was so good that we went twice. The next morning we stayed for the breakfast that was included in our package. It was a mixture of hot and cold items including bacon eggs and grits. Our daughter was even presented with a stack of freshly cooked pancakes from the kitchen. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you Renaissance Staff for making our first trip to Charlotte a very memorable one. We will definitely be back.,Brooke W,Graniteville South Carolina,Room Tip: Room with a balcony is neat.

Waiting for us was champagne flutes and wonderful pastries. The hotel was beautifully decorated and the rooms were spacious and well appointed. We loved the vibe in the bar and the outdoor fire pits. The only minor issue we had was getting a second pillow which took three calls on 2 separate days to housekeeping. And you have to pay for wifi which stinks.

The rooms are spacious – and the little touches like plenty of bathroom counter space a wide space in the tub for toiletries extremely comfortable beds Aveda products and even scented hand scrubs the public bathrooms were most welcome!

First thing we noticed was the area it was located in. There are shops restaurants and the mall right by the hotel! Once we pulled up the doormen were very helpful. We walked in and the hotel receptionist was very nice. She told us she was going to put us in her favorite room but unfortunately it wasn't finished so she put us on the 7th floor which was great. We had a wonderful view of the Mall. The cucumber fused water was interesting and the cookies were great. The hotel looks better than the pictures. On Sunday morning we were awakened by the sunrise which was VERY bright. There is so much to like about this hotel.

It is my favorite Marriott in the area (excluding the Ritz as I have not stayed there). One of my favorite things about it is the concierge lounge. The food is always great and the people working are very friendly. Another reason I like it here is that the doormen are very personable and will do just about anything to help you out. After a recent snowstorm they found someone who had an ice scraper to help me dig my car out of the snow. Danny is especially friendly and always makes a point to greet me even if he is busy doing something else.,boos800,Washington DC District of Columbia,Room Tip: The rooms facing the atrium on the 2nd and 3rd floors have balconies (which was a plus to me but it...

The first one being the Marriott Grande Dunes in Myrtle Beach. When we checked in the front desk clerk was great. She had a great smile and her personality was outstanding. She asked for my last name and because I was a Marriott Reward Customer everything was taken care of and she just handed me my room key. I had a room booked on the Club Level so the clerk took the time to walk with me to show where the elevator and the room where breakfast will be served. In the lobby they had chocolate candy and drinks because of Valentine's day. I forgot to mention they had miniture cupcakes. The room was very clean and smelled good. The bed was ohhh so comfortable and they have great showerheads (always a plus for me). We booked the couple's package and had wine chocolate covered strawberries and pretzels delivered to our room. The breakfast the next morning was great! Even though I live 20 minutes from Charlotte this place will be my little secret getaway when I don't want to travel far. Thank you Marriott for this upscale and elegant hotel. I will be back!

We arrived very late on a Friday night and the front desk staff were very friendly and efficient with check in recommending area attractions for the next day. The room was very clean and met all our needs during our stay. The courtyard area was a great place to unwind each night. The free parking and in particular that parking garage was a nice perk and very convenient to the entrances around the hotel. While we didn't eat breakfast or dinner at the hotel the dining area seemed very nice and the breakfast food looked really good when passing by. The hotel is also in a very nice area with multiple restaurants and a mall within walking distance. Overall we had a great stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone staying in the Charlotte area.,Justin T,Dayton Ohio,Room Tip: We had a room on the 6th floor and it was very quiet.

Unfortunately this is not the case with Renaissance Charlotte SouthPark. Checked us in under one rate sent a bill for a different much higher rate. I spoke to their front desk manager Jessica when I called to resolve this issue. After about five minutes of back in forth she said she had to go and she wasn't going to change my rate.. and that was the end of it. Excuse me?

The decor is modern and vibrant and the lobby is inviting. Depending on the time of day that you arrive you may find hot freshly baked cookies (of which I MAY have had too many) chocolate covered strawberries a variety of fruit and the best lemon/mint/cucumber infused water ever! Everyone from the doorman to the hospitality staff greeted us warmly. We even sat outside in the umbrella covered patio and relaxed before taking in a movie on Saturday afternoon. We were on the 6th floor so not a lot of foot traffic and we didn't hear a lot of noise from the other rooms. Hotel bathrooms and beds are deal breakers for me and I am happy to say that the Renaissance passed my inspection on both :) So if you're going to Charlotte and you want to be comfortable stay close to fantastic shopping and restaurants this is the place for you.

I have to say that this hotel has THE most comfortable beds that I have been in. The rooms are absolutely huge and have a nice real hardwood entrance with newly decorated interiors. The floor that I was on was considered the "concierge" floor that provided upgraded ammenities (AVEDA toiletries that were replenished daily) and complimentary bottled water (that they did not replenish during my stay). The room also had a mini-fridge. The people that work at this hotel are top notch. From the valet who was personable and funny as all get out (I didn't park my car but was dropped off and he opened my door) to the front desk gal (who in the morning arranged for a car service to take me to the airport) to the guy that opens the door for you when you walk in and out - the service was TOP NOTCH. I would recommend this hotel for a business or leisure traveler. Make sure you ask for a corporate rate if you are traveling on business. There are a ton of restaurants around this area that while aren't really walking distance when its cold (maybe 1/2 mile at the most) are certainly convenient. There is also a mall right across the street. Airport is about 15-20 minutes away.,AK L,United States,,43 reviews,Stayed February 2010 travelled on business

It's in a great location - directly across from South Park Mall - and is nice overall . The rooms are well decorated and the public areas (lobby dining bar indoor pool and workout facility are nice.) The breakfast inclusive rate is worth it especially with children - there's a generous buffet and you can also order omelettes and waffles along with the buffet. Every staff member went above and beyond - the service was close to what I usually find at a Ritz Carlton. However it's not perfect - the bathroom was fairly clean but not spotless and the beds were too soft for our taste. The double/double rooms are small and we had a room close to the elevator and vending which was extremely noisy. Since it was so reasonable ($109 including breakfast for the 4 of us) I'd recommend it but I'd ask for a room away from the elevator or perhaps try a suite for about the same price at the other Renaissance near the airport/coliseum.,LettsB,Winston Salem North Carolina,,12 reviews,Stayed January 2010 travelled with family

We were reassured that it was the same as a taxi but the driver tried to charge us more than twice what the cab had the day before. When we returned to the hotel and mentioned the issue the hotel refunded the difference in price. The restaurant in the hotel was OK but inconsistent. One day we had to eat in the bar even though there were people at tables in the restaurant part. The next day they seated us as far from the bar section as they could.

Housekeeping and bartending staff also very friendly and efficient. Snacks and drinks available at front desk. The location is fantastic. Across the street from Southpark mall and and a nice stroll from a mixed-use community (can't remember the name) with restaurants bars a few shops etc. There is a lovely outdoor courtyard; nice spot to have a drink in the evening.

Just a great flow between the ballroom and the courtyard. The food was set up buffet style which I don't always favor but all of the courses were excellent. Outside of the wedding we found the restaurant was very good and all services (bar etc) to be excellent as well. I can strongly recommend this facility.

The front desk service was friendly and welcoming at check-in (I think his name was Pete). Each afternoon there were complementary beverages in the lobby including merlot the first day and champagne the second. The Renaissance is a beautiful hotel especially the first floor lobby area. Perhaps because the weather was a bit on the cool side the hallways and bar/restaurant seemed quite cold... especially as you walk from the hallway into the elevator lobby on the fourth floor. The blast of air from above was annoying. There is a nice size fitness room with five treadmills and several elliptical machines. I never had trouble getting a machine in the morning. One minor quibble... the TVs didn't seem to work on all the treadmills or perhaps I just couldn't figure out how to make them work! There was a small pool (which we didn't use) and a large atrium with rocking chairs (which we did use). We had a large corner room (454) with two comfortable armchairs a hassock and a coffee table... perfect for two people. We like that the room was at the end of the hall especially since there were some noisy people on our floor the second night of our stay... including some bozo who accidentally sent Champagne and chocolate covered pretzels to our room at 11:00 PM. I was a little annoyed that the room service waiter did not apologize for the late night intrusion... he just sort of backed away and left. Room service for breakfast was tasty and I thought reasonably priced for room service. I probably would have added a tip to the bill but there was no space to do so... may I suggest modifying the printout to allow for that option when service is especially good? The Renaissance is located in a great area with many restaurants and Charlotte's upscale Southpark mall. As I mentioned above we like this hotel better than any others we've tried in Charlotte including most recently the Hyatt House Charlotte/Center City and the Ballantyne Hotel. We will definitely be back.,Brian M,Herndon Virginia,,221 reviews,Stayed May 2014 travelled as a couple

GM-Kris Horacek... What can I say? INCREDIBLE! I was searching for a good hotel but reasonable price in Charlotte for a pretty busy weekend. Within my search I find Renaissance South Park with an unbelievable rate. I was skeptical because of the luxurious photo that popped and I wasn't familiar with the South Park area. I called a friend in Charlotte and was informed that the area is very nice but she wasn't familiar with that hotel. I read several reviews and everyone was complimenting Danny. I was a little nervous because most of the hotels were booked in the city and I had a major client that I was traveling with and needed something that matched his taste. i called in advance to make specific arrangements and needed a call back. I was assured my needs would be met and I didn't get the call back which made me nervous. The car service pulled up to the hotel and I was amazed it exceeded the photo. I asked who was Danny and there he was at the front door assisting everyone. When I checked in they new I was arriving and had all my requirements met. I struck up a conversation with a woman in the lobby and explained to her my trepidation about the hotel and how pleased I was upon my arrival. The service and staff was incredible. I asked who's the GM that runs this place and she said I'm Kris Horacek the GM. We shared a good laugh but I was amazed of her hands on work during such a major weekend. There she was in the front meeting and greeting people seeing that the needs were being met. Oh... And the food is great too! Major shout out to Kris Horacek. GM extraordinaire! .,TerkStevens,Washington DC District of Columbia,,1 review,Stayed March 2014 travelled on business

I was there for a wedding weekend and it was perfect. It was large enough to hold 100 people from out of town and still not over run the place. I believe there were several functions going on that weekend but you would never know and the service never suffered for it. Service is top notch for the value of the hotel. Price is really pretty great for the level of service and attention provided. All staff is extremely accommodating and overly helpful. I stayed in the club level which was nice but different from other club levels I have stayed at before. Typically I have experienced that the club lounge is in the club levels and only accessible by a room key. Here the club rooms are on the top floor but the lounge is down a hallway on the first floor tucked away. If I had not have asked I am sure I wouldn't have found it. The only other thing that was not ideal was the bar/cafe hours. They are both closed from 2-4:30. I was working from the hotel room and wanted to grab a bite but not leave the hotel I went down around 2:30 and was out of luck. I was able to go back to my room and order room service but I was looking to get out of my room so that was a little let down. This is my only real gripe. The hotel is updated and. A little funky. Decor is trendy and colorful but not cheesy. The bar is great and so is the atrium and outdoor patio. This is a very large hotel but parking was still fairly painless surprisingly. The rooms are not large but not too small and well appointed. Beds are very comfortable and inviting. I was also pleased to have a mini fridge. All in all we had a fantastic weekend and the hotel was amazing. Highly recommended.,caroline m,Raleigh North Carolina,,18 reviews,Stayed April 2014

We booked the Everything Pink package and it was worth every penny! From the time we arrived in the parking lot to the time we left the staff made us feel like family. This was our very first American Girl Doll experience so we weren't exactly sure what to expect. I can honestly say these people have it together. When we arrived in the parking lot there was a little construction going on and we weren't sure where to park...but Alan (I believe was his name) met us at our window. We told him we were a little early and we weren't sure if we could check in yet. He said it was perfectly fine. He told us where to park and said he would let the staff know we were there. As we were parking he came back out to our car to let us know that our reservation was ready. He was very thoughtful and kind. As soon as we walked through the front door...our little girl was greeted as if she made the reservation herself. She was taken to her very own "check-in" table for her and her doll Grace. She was even given her very own key to our room. When we walked into our room our daughter had the biggest smile on her face. I knew right then that this trip was gonna be amazing. Our room was very clean and the balcony overlooking the atrium was pretty neat too. The courtyard was beautifully decorated with white lights in the trees surrounded with rocking chairs and fire pits. The hotel is located right across the street from the South Park Mall. A nice sidewalk and red light crossing made it very easy to just walk across the street. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the mall as well and it was so good that we went twice. The next morning we stayed for the breakfast that was included in our package. It was a mixture of hot and cold items including bacon eggs and grits. Our daughter was even presented with a stack of freshly cooked pancakes from the kitchen. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

After having an unpleasant stay at the Holiday Inn in downtown Charlotte for one night we booked the remainder of our stay at the Renaissance after seeing multiple great reviews on Trip Advisor. They did not steer us wrong. As a Marriott member they checked me in under my account and when I arrived they had already pre-checked me in and had my key ready. I walked up to the counter and they said "Thank you you and here are your room keys.". My check in literally took all of about 20 seconds. It was AWESOME! The room itself was incredibly clean comfortable and quiet. Everything that we have expected to receive from a Renaissance hotel. The staff was courteous and helpful and the overall presentation of the hotel was updated fresh fun and just felt comfortable. No "ick" factor to be found anywhere. The location of the hotel was great. Close to downtown. Quick to get to Carowinds. Close to shopping restaurants and all the things that you would want to get to. If we're in Charlotte again then we're staying here! On a side note...parking is free in the garage.

There are some pretty good (but not spectacular) restaurants within a short walk and shopping and more variety a quick car ride away. We also had a catered brunch after a wedding here which was delicious.

The room was clean and spacious with a indoor atrium view but the but the room smelled musty. The bed had a "hole" on the side i slept in so it was difficult to get comfortable in at first but once i found a comfortable spot i slept well. The room was very dark and very quiet just the way I like it. We did not eat at the hotel as I was in town for a dinner meeting but we did grab a bottle of wine and went out to the courtyard where they had three gas fire pits surrounded by very comfortable chairs and sofas. We did not spend a lot of time her but this is a very nice hotel but it is about 15 minutes from downtown which depending on how you look at it is a good or bad thing.,BFMitchell893,Walnut Cove North Carolina United States,,42 reviews,Stayed April 2015 travelled as a couple

From the minute I walked up to the hotel I was greeted by the door staff and the registration staff. Everyone went out of their way to be friendly kind and caring. Danny one of the hotel staff members was extremely helpful and caring. He took a personal interest in our satisfaction with the hotel. After talking with him on several occasions he remembered when we arrived and knew when we were leaving offered suggestions of things to do in the area and was just an outstanding person. We could tell he had a big caring heart and he made a lasting impression with us from our visit. I have never written a hotel review before but this experience so moved us that we had to mention it to other travelers. Oh...and by the way the hotel room was wonderful. The bed had the most comfortable mattress and the furnishings of the lobby and each floor were beautiful. I definitely recommend this hotel to others.

We booked the American Girl/Everything Pink package for our stay. We could not have asked for friendlier more welcoming staff and beautiful accomodations. Our daughter was treated so well from the moment we walked through the doors. The staff was wonderful all weekend even remembering that it was my daughter's birthday and always making sure to talk to her. The room was also perfect my daughter couldn't believe it was all for her! The beds were so comfortable. Breakfast was great with a very nice selection. The indoor pool was warm never crowded. We weren't able to visit the courtyard due to private parties both nights but we had a nice view from our room and it looked very inviting. The mall was just across the street within walking distance. We had a great trip and will definitely stay here again.,Pamela S,Nashville North Carolina,,1 review,Stayed April 2015 travelled with family

After having an unpleasant stay at the Holiday Inn in downtown Charlotte for one night we booked the remainder of our stay at the Renaissance after seeing multiple great reviews on Trip Advisor. They did not steer us wrong. As a Marriott member they checked me in under my account and when I arrived they had already pre-checked me in and had my key ready. I walked up to the counter and they said "Thank you you and here are your room keys.". My check in literally took all of about 20 seconds. It was AWESOME! The room itself was incredibly clean comfortable and quiet. Everything that we have expected to receive from a Renaissance hotel. The staff was courteous and helpful and the overall presentation of the hotel was updated fresh fun and just felt comfortable. No "ick" factor to be found anywhere. The location of the hotel was great. Close to downtown. Quick to get to Carowinds. Close to shopping restaurants and all the things that you would want to get to. If we're in Charlotte again then we're staying here! On a side note...parking is free in the garage. However if you want free wi-fi then you need to be a Mariott rewards member.,FamilyGuyFromIndy,Indianapolis IN,,26 reviews,Stayed April 2015 travelled as a couple

We booked the Everything Pink package and it was worth every penny! From the time we arrived in the parking lot to the time we left the staff made us feel like family. This was our very first American Girl Doll experience so we weren't exactly sure what to expect. I can honestly say these people have it together. When we arrived in the parking lot there was a little construction going on and we weren't sure where to park...but Alan (I believe was his name) met us at our window. We told him we were a little early and we weren't sure if we could check in yet. He said it was perfectly fine. He told us where to park and said he would let the staff know we were there. As we were parking he came back out to our car to let us know that our reservation was ready. He was very thoughtful and kind. As soon as we walked through the front door...our little girl was greeted as if she made the reservation herself. She was taken to her very own "check-in" table for her and her doll Grace. She was even given her very own key to our room. When we walked into our room our daughter had the biggest smile on her face. I knew right then that this trip was gonna be amazing. Our room was very clean and the balcony overlooking the atrium was pretty neat too. The courtyard was beautifully decorated with white lights in the trees surrounded with rocking chairs and fire pits. The hotel is located right across the street from the South Park Mall. A nice sidewalk and red light crossing made it very easy to just walk across the street. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the mall as well and it was so good that we went twice. The next morning we stayed for the breakfast that was included in our package. It was a mixture of hot and cold items including bacon eggs and grits. Our daughter was even presented with a stack of freshly cooked pancakes from the kitchen. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you Renaissance Staff for making our first trip to Charlotte a very memorable one. We will definitely be back.,Brooke W,Graniteville South Carolina,Room Tip: Room with a balcony is neat.

We were within walking distance of Piedmont Natural Gas (business meetings) as well as that wonderful mall right across the street. Being so close to the mall and great restaurants like Cowfish made our stay much more enjoyable. The rooms were very nice and I slept great feeling refreshed each morning.

The stay was a bit pricey (compared to the same package at an Atlanta hotel that we had previously done) but worth it. Everything about this hotel was over the top! From the $700 tipsy topsy chairs in the foyer that my daughter loved so much she googled and asked me to buy her one to the very plush rooms! Amelia Gustafson was EXTREMELY helpful from ensuring that everything was perfect for our American Girl package to even helping me find a restaurant for dinner! Amazingly friendly and helpful you have a very special lady in her! I was so upset that she had left for the day upon our check in as I looked so forward to meeting her!

Was here as opposed to the South Park Marriott and the Double Tree owing to high demand at those hotels on this particular trip. Check-in was very fast and efficient. The public areas are wonderfully appointed and quite inviting. My room was on the fourh floor and although it was right near the elevator I barely noticed any of the sounds that you usually hear in a elevator common area. Sleep quality was better than most hotels Ive stayed at with a generous amount of pillows and comfortable sheets and mattress. The bathroom actually had a decent bath tub which I like and the lighting was ample. Concierge service was helpful - guiding us to not only a good restaurant experience but also arranging for a car service for us to the CLT airport.

From James who coordinated things for us to Danny who was awesome to our group - to Regina who served our meals - to Erin who coordinated the whole event ... You all just are awesome.

It is my favorite Marriott in the area (excluding the Ritz as I have not stayed there). One of my favorite things about it is the concierge lounge. The food is always great and the people working are very friendly. Another reason I like it here is that the doormen are very personable and will do just about anything to help you out. After a recent snowstorm they found someone who had an ice scraper to help me dig my car out of the snow. Danny is especially friendly and always makes a point to greet me even if he is busy doing something else.,boos800,Washington DC District of Columbia,Room Tip: The rooms facing the atrium on the 2nd and 3rd floors have balconies (which was a plus to me but it...

The first one being the Marriott Grande Dunes in Myrtle Beach. When we checked in the front desk clerk was great. She had a great smile and her personality was outstanding. She asked for my last name and because I was a Marriott Reward Customer everything was taken care of and she just handed me my room key. I had a room booked on the Club Level so the clerk took the time to walk with me to show where the elevator and the room where breakfast will be served. In the lobby they had chocolate candy and drinks because of Valentine's day. I forgot to mention they had miniture cupcakes. The room was very clean and smelled good. The bed was ohhh so comfortable and they have great showerheads (always a plus for me). We booked the couple's package and had wine chocolate covered strawberries and pretzels delivered to our room. The breakfast the next morning was great! Even though I live 20 minutes from Charlotte this place will be my little secret getaway when I don't want to travel far. Thank you Marriott for this upscale and elegant hotel. I will be back! And I have recommended this hotel to all my friends and told them what a treat is was to be there.,Tamara68,Rock Hill South Carolina,,39 reviews,Stayed February 2014 travelled as a couple

Danny at the front door made us feel so welcome when we arrived in the evening after a long drive. The front desk staff was exceptional and made a effort to accommodate my husband and I with our choice not to drink by providing us with a punch rather than champagne that went with the chocolate covered strawberries.. The room was amazing and our view of Charlotte was wonderful.. We definitely felt like first priority while we were there. The checkout process was seemless.. The hotel does charge for wi-fi but we stayed on concierge level so it was free..

Agree with the reviewer about the "wacky lobby furnishings" but disagree with one who complained about rude staff. I'm picky about that and have always found the front desk and bell staff here to be friendly and welcoming. They greet you coming and going hold doors open answer questions. Housekeeping and bartending staff also very friendly and efficient. Snacks and drinks available at front desk. The location is fantastic. Across the street from Southpark mall and and a nice stroll from a mixed-use community (can't remember the name) with restaurants bars a few shops etc. There is a lovely outdoor courtyard; nice spot to have a drink in the evening. No outdoor pool which would have been nice. Only other complaint I have with this hotel is one I have with most hotels pillows are wayyyyy too soft like sleeping on sawdust.,donnp,Waynesville North Carolina,,8 reviews,Stayed July 2015 travelled with family

Location is good for shopping (across street from South Park Mall complex) and dining (wide variety of restaurants within 3-4 blocks). And it is even possible to get downtown in less than 10 minutes -- I found this out when I had to rush my wife to the hospital after she had a bad fall and needed stitches -- though it is usually more like 15 minutes. Similarly even in traffic one can make the airport in about 20 minutes. The hotel is comfortable. Good public rooms nice restaurant popular bar good selection of machines in the fitness center but best of all is the attention of the staff. Always available and helpful the staff is this hotel's best asset. I give the rooms themselves a mixed review. Certainly the bed is comfortable. But the only other place to sit in the rooms besides the bed is a rolling desk chair (at the very nice desk). At these prices and this high of a star-rating I expect at least some sort of straight or overstuffed chair if not a sofa. Again to the staff's credit they gladly found us one when I explained that my wife couldn't even put on her shoes without a better place to sit. I have to rely on my granddaughter's evaluation of the pool as enjoyable. I appreciate that it is a salt-water pool instead of chlorine. I would have liked a hot tub. There is internet in the room for Marriott Reward's members or those willing to pay an exorbitant fee. (Or use the free internet available in the lobby.)

The bellmen are amazing. They are quick to provide cold bottled water and an umbrella if asked for. One day I asked for some sunscreen and was helped out with some for my 2 year old for free. They are very informative and willing to help out with directions and tips on where to go. The staff in the restaurant are amazing and very friendly. I only wish I would have chosen to eat there every day rather than just on my last. Our room service was great every time we ordered. I only have 2 complaints. Our room although comfortable and clean was situated mid hallway and the opening and closing of the doors of other guests was quite disruptive throughout the night. The pool area was great. Very clean and warm however on our first night someone left the outside door open and my 2 year old and I got bitten by tons of mosquitos. I called the front desk and was provided with bug spray immediately but the damage had already been done. Not the hotels fault though...Overall this is a beautiful hotel with very accommodating staff. Sidenote have some of the infused water that you'll find in the lobby and fitness area...it is amazing!!!,SanDee P,United States,,70 reviews,Stayed July 2014 travelled with family

The décor and atmosphere are inviting the restaurant is top notch for breakfast lunch or dinner. At the end of the day the sound of a gong lets guests know that a special ‘drink-and-treat-of-the-day’ is being offered in the lobby. All of the staff were attentive and accommodating. The rooms are spacious – and the little touches like plenty of bathroom counter space a wide space in the tub for toiletries extremely comfortable beds Aveda products and even scented hand scrubs the public bathrooms were most welcome! There are a variety of small and large seating areas - some whimsical and some retro. An open outdoor area with a huge tree and other live greenery is the perfect place to kick back and relax anytime during your stay. Fire pits are lit as the weather cools.

From the warm greeting by Danny as I drove up to check in I found a multitude of exemplary details at this hotel. The décor and atmosphere are inviting the restaurant is top notch for breakfast lunch or dinner. At the end of the day the sound of a gong lets guests know that a special ‘drink-and-treat-of-the-day’ is being offered in the lobby. All of the staff were attentive and accommodating. The rooms are spacious – and the little touches like plenty of bathroom counter space a wide space in the tub for toiletries extremely comfortable beds Aveda products and even scented hand scrubs the public bathrooms were most welcome! There are a variety of small and large seating areas - some whimsical and some retro. An open outdoor area with a huge tree and other live greenery is the perfect place to kick back and relax anytime during your stay. Fire pits are lit as the weather cools. I am looking forward to my next visit!,Karen W,Columbia South Carolina,,1 review,Stayed August 2015 travelled on business

However the meeting space was very nice and the luncheon served for the participants ( by the hotel) was outstanding! Fully expecting the ho hum cold buffet spread- the catering far exceeded the usual hotel faire. Only other comment I would make to the hotel is after arriving later in the evening I found the hotel parking and outside to be quite dark with nothing available but a deck in the back.

Location is good for shopping (across street from South Park Mall complex) and dining (wide variety of restaurants within 3-4 blocks). And it is even possible to get downtown in less than 10 minutes -- I found this out when I had to rush my wife to the hospital after she had a bad fall and needed stitches -- though it is usually more like 15 minutes. Similarly even in traffic one can make the airport in about 20 minutes. The hotel is comfortable. Good public rooms nice restaurant popular bar good selection of machines in the fitness center but best of all is the attention of the staff. Always available and helpful the staff is this hotel's best asset. I give the rooms themselves a mixed review. Certainly the bed is comfortable. But the only other place to sit in the rooms besides the bed is a rolling desk chair (at the very nice desk). At these prices and this high of a star-rating I expect at least some sort of straight or overstuffed chair if not a sofa. Again to the staff's credit they gladly found us one when I explained that my wife couldn't even put on her shoes without a better place to sit. I have to rely on my granddaughter's evaluation of the pool as enjoyable. I appreciate that it is a salt-water pool instead of chlorine. I would have liked a hot tub. There is internet in the room for Marriott Reward's members or those willing to pay an exorbitant fee. (Or use the free internet available in the lobby.) Likewise a fantastic hot breakfast is available but it is included with only some bookings not all. I highly recommend it.,turkce_bilmiyorum,Delavan Illinois,Room Tip: Upper floors are quieter.

We travel often and we've stayed at numerous Marriott properties in various states but this is absolutely one of the best we've seen to date. The outside of the property looks very nice and it's located directly across the street from South Park Mall so it has that kind of upscale feel to it. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered the building and were greeted with the nicest scent... this hotel smells really nice inside! I know that sounds like a strange comment to make for a hotel but we've stayed at many hotels in the Marriott chain that smell nice at the lobby and then smell a little musty and damp when you actually go on room floors. This one had the most pleasant smell from the time you walked in the door all the way through the hallways (even upstairs) and into the room. Very very nice way to greet your guests. The staff were wonderful and got us checked in quickly and efficiently. We were also very pleased with the room we had. We stayed in the Executive King Suite and it was very roomy for the two of us. Nice to see hardwood (laminate?) floors in a hotel room gave the place a very upscale feel. Love the Presidential Collection bathrobe in the room as well!

This is easily a $30 + value costing only $10 extra per night for great food & service! For couples without children who are AAA members the AAA weekend Leisure rate is also a great deal if you aren't interested in having the full breakfast at the hotel. On weekday mornings they also have a full complimentary breakfast spread in the Elite member Concierge Lounge. Our room was very clean with super comfortable beds. For parents with children you might inquire about booking one of the rooms with a balcony to enjoy relaxing or having a glass of wine overlooking the pretty indoor atrium after putting the kids to bed. For large families or groups booking multiple rooms there are plenty of nice public areas to meet and relax together in the lobby / atrium courtyard patio restaurant or bar / lounge indoor pool fitness room etc. We arrived very late from the airport on our first night and we were starving so we walked to Taco Mac a sports bar which is open until 2 a.m. and allows minors anytime at certain tables.

Let me first say the hotel was great and the staff was wonderful. However be wary of the Events Manager. We thought she was wonderful and was going to take great care of us and our guest. We made two specific trips to the hotel as we also are from out of town to meet with the Event Manager and to ensure we had all necessary arrangments made. We had a simple request to ensure all of our guest who booked in the room block we arranged would be on the same floor as we the hosts would be. Two primary purposes so that it would be conveninet for them to enjoy the hospitality room we were hosting and to ensure we did not distrurb other hotel guests who were not part of our group with noise from our celebration. We also had the bride to be staying in the hotel and wanted to ensure she stayed in a room away from all other guests to ensure her privacy and ability to rest well the night before the wedding. Word of caution. If you use this hotel be sure the Event Manager passes all the arrangements you make to athe appropriate hotel stay for execution. Despite the planning the Event Manager never passed the information to the front desk. Totally dropped the ball. We should have suspected something was wrong when we checked in. The front desk was clueless to the arrangments made for our rooms and hospitality room. All of our guest were placed on a different floor then we were and in fact were on the same floor as the bride to be! All had a good time but what a disappointment. And all the hotel had to say was sorry. Sure we received a personal phone call from the Events Manager explaining what happened offering an apology. But that was it. Essentially we're sorry but too bad too sad. They had are money (of course you have to pay in advance). We'll never use this hotel again and strongly suggest caution should you decide to hold an event at this hotel.,Mark581016,Raleigh North Carolina,,3 reviews,Stayed June 2012 travelled with family

Depending on the time of day that you arrive you may find hot freshly baked cookies (of which I MAY have had too many) chocolate covered strawberries a variety of fruit and the best lemon/mint/cucumber infused water ever! Everyone from the doorman to the hospitality staff greeted us warmly. We even sat outside in the umbrella covered patio and relaxed before taking in a movie on Saturday afternoon. We were on the 6th floor so not a lot of foot traffic and we didn't hear a lot of noise from the other rooms. Hotel bathrooms and beds are deal breakers for me and I am happy to say that the Renaissance passed my inspection on both :) So if you're going to Charlotte and you want to be comfortable stay close to fantastic shopping and restaurants this is the place for you.

We travel often and we've stayed at numerous Marriott properties in various states but this is absolutely one of the best we've seen to date. The outside of the property looks very nice and it's located directly across the street from South Park Mall so it has that kind of upscale feel to it. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered the building and were greeted with the nicest scent... this hotel smells really nice inside! I know that sounds like a strange comment to make for a hotel but we've stayed at many hotels in the Marriott chain that smell nice at the lobby and then smell a little musty and damp when you actually go on room floors. This one had the most pleasant smell from the time you walked in the door all the way through the hallways (even upstairs) and into the room. Very very nice way to greet your guests. The staff were wonderful and got us checked in quickly and efficiently. We were also very pleased with the room we had. We stayed in the Executive King Suite and it was very roomy for the two of us. Nice to see hardwood (laminate?) floors in a hotel room gave the place a very upscale feel. Love the Presidential Collection bathrobe in the room as well!

The hotel is beautiful and offers many lounging areas. The infused water and mini desserts or a nice treat upon arrival. The room was nice and clean and the bed was comfortable. However I don't recommend ordering breakfast unless you specify exactly how you like everything cooked. The scrambled eggs were super wet and the hashbrowns were too. The little packets of butter were liquid because it was wrapped on the top of my toast. The bacon was to my liking but if you like it crisper you'll need to specify. The breakfast was the only thing I was disappointed in... especially for the price! But I would stay here again and recommend it to others just no breakfast!,Maggie K,Hgih Point North Carolina,,67 reviews,Stayed November 2015 travelled as a couple

It is very nice. 15 story atrium style building with rooms encircling all four sides. Huge and impressive. Fine dinning and friendly bar with elegant water features in the atrium center. The rooms are posh and they cater to your every need. Directions to near by attractions and recommendations of local must dos. Being from Arizona I was most impressed with the grounds the magnolia trees around the property are heavenly scented. The staff is remarkable they have obviously selected some of the best people to cater to their guests. Everyone is genuinely passionate about what they do. I was sad to leave this place.

The doorman Danny might just possibly be the sweetest kindest most helpful person I've ever met. Just a really genuine caring person and you can tell he loves and takes pride in his work making people feel at home while away from home. The special feeling you get from him holding the door open for you and insisting on helping you just continues at the front desk then at the cocktail station just before the elevator to your room where you are greeted with the concoction of the day! We held our team meeting here and loved everything about it! The food was great the rooms spotless and every staff member was over the top. Almost makes you want to have another meeting before the next one is due! Fabulous!!,soccermom0109,Cornelius North Carolina,,2 reviews,Stayed December 2015 travelled on business

Danny the gentleman at the front door must have been an Angel in disguise lifting my spirit immediately from his most hospitable and kind greeting holding the door for me slowly making my way in. The staff were all so friendly and super efficient with superior service. I visited the pool to get prepared for upcoming surgery and the environment was so appealing seemingly private that it boosted my morale for the rigorous walk in wonderland water! Later when I departed Danny once again showed so much kindness that I imagine weary travelers should immediately feel at home with the Renaissance Hotel staff and Danny smiling at the door.

Two beds were requested for our girlfriends weekend away. When checking in we were told they only had rooms with king beds. Told it was a busy weekend. Staff seemed to care less. We explained that we were not interested in sharing a king size bed. They told us there was nothing they could do. Never offered to check another hotel. Our problem got resolved because a woman standing next to us over heard the conversation and offered to take a king room and give us her room that had two beds. She had already been in her room but was more than happy to help us. Front desk staff seemed "put out" because now they had to switch guest information between the rooms. Very obvious they just wanted us to take the king room. Not our first stay but probably our last.

However I was greeted so warmly - welcomed as if I was a favorite regular guest! The ladies of the front desk - "ambassadors" - were all so pleasant. My ambassador was Anna Kate and she could not have been more gracious and helpful. Anything I asked for or about she had the answers and a map at the ready. She even offered to show me the room I had reserved since it was my first visit to the property to make sure it was suitable! No need - it was quite comfortable. The beds are particularly cushy. I rarely sleep well the first night of a hotel stay but this was an exception. I do wish the coffee bar had been stocked but this was a minor oversight. I prefer the fresh coffee from the lobby anyway. There is room service and had I thought of it I would have taken advantage of breakfast in room. The location is so very convenient. South Park Mall is across the street and there are many restaurants in the area as well. If one needed to walk there are many options. I did not eat at the hotel's restaurant however it seemed quite pleasant as it is located in the atrium. Bright and sunny. Upon checkout a new group of ambassadors seemed genuinely interested as to the comfort of my stay as well. When I have the need to stay in the area again this will be my only choice!

I went out in the hall and you could definitely hear it out there. So not our a/c. We were already in bed and too lazy to complain and move . We did use our gold elite bonus points. Not sure if that had anything to do with where our room was. We would stay again but definitely stay in another part of the hotel.

He helped me with my luggage from the car to my room. Amy and Raina at the front desk were always very helpful every time I needed something. I had been dealing with Jenni in events leading up to my arrival to the hotel and she was always more than helpful quick to respond to all of my requests via phone or email. Just the best! James in banquet catering and his staff (Jason and Kevin) were also amazing I never was in need or want for anything. They really made sure that all of the members of the company were well taken care of. Regina Carlos Danielle and Jeffrey the servers and bartenders were also always on point if one of our meetings ended early they quickly adjusted so that we never ever had to wait for a meal or snack or coffee break. Jessica and Lisa in reservations were also amazing and patient we had to make so many changes and additions to the room reservations and they always were willing and able and quick to make the necessary changes. All in all our event was a total success because of the AMAZING staff at this hotel. I would advise anyone looking to hold a corporate event wedding party etc. to look into this hotel you will not be disappointed.

He wanted to stay at the Double Tree down the street and I wanted to stay here because of the reviews about the great beds that I read here on Trip Advisor. We both needed a comfortable room to catch up on our sleep after our date. Unfortunately that was not the case here. I should have known when we walked in the room and immediately smelled a musty/mildew odor. After a while we got used to the smell and we decided not to make a big deal about it. BIG MISTAKE. After a nice evening out - dinner and a movie - we headed back to the room for some R & R. As it turns out the air conditioning unit did not work. We both woke up at 3:00 a.m. sweating from the warmth and humidity in the room. My husband even thought I had turned the heat on! It would have been better if we had been able to at least crack a window. Not an option. After messing with the air conditioner and TRYING to sleep we called the front desk two hours later. They were nice enough - apologized and gave us a $25 discount on the room and asked it we wanted to change rooms. However that was not an option as it was already 5:00 a.m. and all we wanted to do was sleep - not pack up our things again and move! We never really went back to sleep. Upon leaving we realized that even the hallway was much more comfortable than our room!!! My question is - how does the hotel staff really not know that this is a problem especially when the room smells like mildew? Obviously this has been an issue in this room for a while. While the bed was very comfortable (again a key reason why we stayed here) and the room was decorated fine we will not be staying here again. I left feeling wiped out from being awake from 3:00 on - not rejuvenated as we had hoped.

My husband and I stayed here this past weekend for a romantic get-away. The location is great as we wanted to be near great food and shopping. Our room was at the end of the hall so we were not bothered by much noise. The hotel is in need of interior updates. Dining and room service leave much to be desired. Pros: - Great location for shopping and restaurants. - The valet service was extremely courteous and efficient. - Bar tender was very pleasant. - When a second robe was requested it was delivered within minutes. - Beds are extremely comfortable. - Room furnishings were ample. Cons: - Skip the hotel breakfast. We sat for 10 minutes before a server acknowledged us and took our drink order. I passed on the mediocre looking buffet and opted for a made to order omelet. I was given the wrong omelet and the server never checked back with us. Even though we purchased breakfast for two days with our room we skipped it the second day. - Furnishing in the bar need replaced. All of the bar stools were scratched up and felt like they were about to fall apart. - The second morning of our stay we opted for coffee juice and bagels in our room. We placed our breakfast card on the door at 11 PM (cut-off is 2 AM) and no one picked it up. However someone did make a point of dropping off our bill. When my husband went downstairs to get some coffee he heard another guest complaining about the exact same thing. Apparently the person responsible for picking up breakfast cards was a no-show. I would think that the person who dropped off the bills would have noticed the oversight and communicated to management that breakfast cards were not picked up. If it wasn't for the poor breakfast and in-room dining service I probably would have rated my experience as Very Good. This hotel has a lot of potential with some interior updates and more focus on top quality service that you would expect from a Marriott Renaissance property.,pantherfan1,Charlotte NC,,28 reviews,Stayed March 2010 travelled as a couple

It's in a great location - directly across from South Park Mall - and is nice overall . The rooms are well decorated and the public areas (lobby dining bar indoor pool and workout facility are nice.) The breakfast inclusive rate is worth it especially with children - there's a generous buffet and you can also order omelettes and waffles along with the buffet. Every staff member went above and beyond - the service was close to what I usually find at a Ritz Carlton. However it's not perfect - the bathroom was fairly clean but not spotless and the beds were too soft for our taste. The double/double rooms are small and we had a room close to the elevator and vending which was extremely noisy. Since it was so reasonable ($109 including breakfast for the 4 of us) I'd recommend it but I'd ask for a room away from the elevator or perhaps try a suite for about the same price at the other Renaissance near the airport/coliseum.,LettsB,Winston Salem North Carolina,,12 reviews,Stayed January 2010 travelled with family

When we returned to the hotel and mentioned the issue the hotel refunded the difference in price. The restaurant in the hotel was OK but inconsistent. One day we had to eat in the bar even though there were people at tables in the restaurant part. The next day they seated us as far from the bar section as they could.

All of these items were in the room waiting for us as we requested. The room was ok. I've seen better (and I've also seen worse). We didn't get a chance to do much exploring but it looks like it's in a location that is close to retail shopping and restaurants. Since our room rate included the breakfast buffet we decided to have breakfast there. I would not recommend the breakfast buffet as a separate purchase. At $15 per person it's just not worth the money. The fruit was good but selection of hot items was small and disappointing.

I have to say that this hotel has THE most comfortable beds that I have been in. The rooms are absolutely huge and have a nice real hardwood entrance with newly decorated interiors. The floor that I was on was considered the "concierge" floor that provided upgraded ammenities (AVEDA toiletries that were replenished daily) and complimentary bottled water (that they did not replenish during my stay). The room also had a mini-fridge. The people that work at this hotel are top notch. From the valet who was personable and funny as all get out (I didn't park my car but was dropped off and he opened my door) to the front desk gal (who in the morning arranged for a car service to take me to the airport) to the guy that opens the door for you when you walk in and out - the service was TOP NOTCH. I would recommend this hotel for a business or leisure traveler. Make sure you ask for a corporate rate if you are traveling on business. There are a ton of restaurants around this area that while aren't really walking distance when its cold (maybe 1/2 mile at the most) are certainly convenient. There is also a mall right across the street. Airport is about 15-20 minutes away.,AK L,United States,,43 reviews,Stayed February 2010 travelled on business

It's in a great location - directly across from South Park Mall - and is nice overall . The rooms are well decorated and the public areas (lobby dining bar indoor pool and workout facility are nice.) The breakfast inclusive rate is worth it especially with children - there's a generous buffet and you can also order omelettes and waffles along with the buffet. Every staff member went above and beyond - the service was close to what I usually find at a Ritz Carlton. However it's not perfect - the bathroom was fairly clean but not spotless and the beds were too soft for our taste. The double/double rooms are small and we had a room close to the elevator and vending which was extremely noisy. Since it was so reasonable ($109 including breakfast for the 4 of us) I'd recommend it but I'd ask for a room away from the elevator or perhaps try a suite for about the same price at the other Renaissance near the airport/coliseum.,LettsB,Winston Salem North Carolina,,12 reviews,Stayed January 2010 travelled with family

We travel often and we've stayed at numerous Marriott properties in various states but this is absolutely one of the best we've seen to date. The outside of the property looks very nice and it's located directly across the street from South Park Mall so it has that kind of upscale feel to it. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered the building and were greeted with the nicest scent... this hotel smells really nice inside! I know that sounds like a strange comment to make for a hotel but we've stayed at many hotels in the Marriott chain that smell nice at the lobby and then smell a little musty and damp when you actually go on room floors. This one had the most pleasant smell from the time you walked in the door all the way through the hallways (even upstairs) and into the room. Very very nice way to greet your guests. The staff were wonderful and got us checked in quickly and efficiently. We were also very pleased with the room we had. We stayed in the Executive King Suite and it was very roomy for the two of us. Nice to see hardwood (laminate?) floors in a hotel room gave the place a very upscale feel. Love the Presidential Collection bathrobe in the room as well!

My ambassador was Anna Kate and she could not have been more gracious and helpful. Anything I asked for or about she had the answers and a map at the ready. She even offered to show me the room I had reserved since it was my first visit to the property to make sure it was suitable! No need - it was quite comfortable. The beds are particularly cushy. I rarely sleep well the first night of a hotel stay but this was an exception. I do wish the coffee bar had been stocked but this was a minor oversight. I prefer the fresh coffee from the lobby anyway. There is room service and had I thought of it I would have taken advantage of breakfast in room. The location is so very convenient. South Park Mall is across the street and there are many restaurants in the area as well. If one needed to walk there are many options. I did not eat at the hotel's restaurant however it seemed quite pleasant as it is located in the atrium. Bright and sunny.

However I was greeted so warmly - welcomed as if I was a favorite regular guest! The ladies of the front desk - "ambassadors" - were all so pleasant. My ambassador was Anna Kate and she could not have been more gracious and helpful. Anything I asked for or about she had the answers and a map at the ready. She even offered to show me the room I had reserved since it was my first visit to the property to make sure it was suitable! No need - it was quite comfortable. The beds are particularly cushy. I rarely sleep well the first night of a hotel stay but this was an exception. I do wish the coffee bar had been stocked but this was a minor oversight. I prefer the fresh coffee from the lobby anyway. There is room service and had I thought of it I would have taken advantage of breakfast in room. The location is so very convenient. South Park Mall is across the street and there are many restaurants in the area as well. If one needed to walk there are many options. I did not eat at the hotel's restaurant however it seemed quite pleasant as it is located in the atrium. Bright and sunny. Upon checkout a new group of ambassadors seemed genuinely interested as to the comfort of my stay as well. When I have the need to stay in the area again this will be my only choice! Thanks to all as I appreciate pleasant people!,Dawnroselady,Winston Salem North Carolina,Room Tip: I was booked on a higher floor which is always my preference.

I have never spent time in Charlotte and didn't expect much from our stay but we were in for a big surprise! This hotel is absolutely fantastic! The employees are incredibly hospitable and helpful.

From initial arrival with a tremendously helpful Bell Hop to a warm and genuine desk attendant we were always made to feel welcome. We were lucky enough to reserve and rent The Presidential Suite which was absolutely wonderful. We found the doubles very warm and comfortable as well. The wedding was held in the courtyard and dining and dancing in an adjacent room with plenty of space and ready access to the bar (one in the room one in the general space leading to ballrooms. Just a great flow between the ballroom and the courtyard. The food was set up buffet style which I don't always favor but all of the courses were excellent. Outside of the wedding we found the restaurant was very good and all services (bar etc) to be excellent as well. I can strongly recommend this facility.

The front desk service was friendly and welcoming at check-in (I think his name was Pete). Each afternoon there were complementary beverages in the lobby including merlot the first day and champagne the second. The Renaissance is a beautiful hotel especially the first floor lobby area. Perhaps because the weather was a bit on the cool side the hallways and bar/restaurant seemed quite cold... especially as you walk from the hallway into the elevator lobby on the fourth floor. The blast of air from above was annoying. There is a nice size fitness room with five treadmills and several elliptical machines. I never had trouble getting a machine in the morning. One minor quibble... the TVs didn't seem to work on all the treadmills or perhaps I just couldn't figure out how to make them work! There was a small pool (which we didn't use) and a large atrium with rocking chairs (which we did use). We had a large corner room (454) with two comfortable armchairs a hassock and a coffee table... perfect for two people. We like that the room was at the end of the hall especially since there were some noisy people on our floor the second night of our stay... including some bozo who accidentally sent Champagne and chocolate covered pretzels to our room at 11:00 PM. I was a little annoyed that the room service waiter did not apologize for the late night intrusion... he just sort of backed away and left. Room service for breakfast was tasty and I thought reasonably priced for room service. I probably would have added a tip to the bill but there was no space to do so... may I suggest modifying the printout to allow for that option when service is especially good? The Renaissance is located in a great area with many restaurants and Charlotte's upscale Southpark mall. As I mentioned above we like this hotel better than any others we've tried in Charlotte including most recently the Hyatt House Charlotte/Center City and the Ballantyne Hotel.

I asked who's the GM that runs this place and she said I'm Kris Horacek the GM. We shared a good laugh but I was amazed of her hands on work during such a major weekend.

I was there for a wedding weekend and it was perfect. It was large enough to hold 100 people from out of town and still not over run the place. I believe there were several functions going on that weekend but you would never know and the service never suffered for it. Service is top notch for the value of the hotel. Price is really pretty great for the level of service and attention provided. All staff is extremely accommodating and overly helpful. I stayed in the club level which was nice but different from other club levels I have stayed at before. Typically I have experienced that the club lounge is in the club levels and only accessible by a room key. Here the club rooms are on the top floor but the lounge is down a hallway on the first floor tucked away. If I had not have asked I am sure I wouldn't have found it. The only other thing that was not ideal was the bar/cafe hours. They are both closed from 2-4:30. I was working from the hotel room and wanted to grab a bite but not leave the hotel I went down around 2:30 and was out of luck. I was able to go back to my room and order room service but I was looking to get out of my room so that was a little let down. This is my only real gripe. The hotel is updated and. A little funky. Decor is trendy and colorful but not cheesy. The bar is great and so is the atrium and outdoor patio. This is a very large hotel but parking was still fairly painless surprisingly. The rooms are not large but not too small and well appointed. Beds are very comfortable and inviting. I was also pleased to have a mini fridge. All in all we had a fantastic weekend and the hotel was amazing. Highly recommended.,caroline m,Raleigh North Carolina,,18 reviews,Stayed April 2014

I was there for a wedding weekend and it was perfect. It was large enough to hold 100 people from out of town and still not over run the place. I believe there were several functions going on that weekend but you would never know and the service never suffered for it. Service is top notch for the value of the hotel. Price is really pretty great for the level of service and attention provided. All staff is extremely accommodating and overly helpful. I stayed in the club level which was nice but different from other club levels I have stayed at before. Typically I have experienced that the club lounge is in the club levels and only accessible by a room key. Here the club rooms are on the top floor but the lounge is down a hallway on the first floor tucked away. If I had not have asked I am sure I wouldn't have found it. The only other thing that was not ideal was the bar/cafe hours. They are both closed from 2-4:30. I was working from the hotel room and wanted to grab a bite but not leave the hotel I went down around 2:30 and was out of luck. I was able to go back to my room and order room service but I was looking to get out of my room so that was a little let down. This is my only real gripe. The hotel is updated and. A little funky. Decor is trendy and colorful but not cheesy. The bar is great and so is the atrium and outdoor patio. This is a very large hotel but parking was still fairly painless surprisingly. The rooms are not large but not too small and well appointed. Beds are very comfortable and inviting. I was also pleased to have a mini fridge. All in all we had a fantastic weekend and the hotel was amazing. Highly recommended.,caroline m,Raleigh North Carolina,,18 reviews,Stayed April 2014

From the moment I stepped out of my cab I knew my stay was going to be awesome. I was greeted by Danny one of the lovely gentleman outside. When I checked in I was helped by a very nice gentleman who took me to the center of the lobby to give me the lay of the land. There was a DELICIOUS complimentary martini table set-up in the lobby in the evening. The room was very clean comfortable and quiet. Every time I wanted in/out the lobby door I was greeted warmly by everyone...and they would go out of their way to say hello. Danny again at the front door was so helpful so friendly so welcoming. I enjoyed conversation with him very much. He gave me wonderful directions to get to a Rite Aid around the corner.

After having an unpleasant stay at the Holiday Inn in downtown Charlotte for one night we booked the remainder of our stay at the Renaissance after seeing multiple great reviews on Trip Advisor. They did not steer us wrong. As a Marriott member they checked me in under my account and when I arrived they had already pre-checked me in and had my key ready. I walked up to the counter and they said "Thank you you and here are your room keys.". My check in literally took all of about 20 seconds. It was AWESOME! The room itself was incredibly clean comfortable and quiet. Everything that we have expected to receive from a Renaissance hotel. The staff was courteous and helpful and the overall presentation of the hotel was updated fresh fun and just felt comfortable. No "ick" factor to be found anywhere. The location of the hotel was great. Close to downtown. Quick to get to Carowinds. Close to shopping restaurants and all the things that you would want to get to.

The lobby is spacious with a bar restaurant tucked around the corner...but there is an open ceiling to the top of the hotel so noise carries. There may be table stop eat but the vibe was more bar and the evening I was there it was taken over by a group attending a conference and was less than inviting. The room was standard hotel size lighting okay enough electrical outlets internet adequate furniture up to date and bed comfortable. Nothing special but nothing wring either. Workout area is large and clean but the door is key protected and didn't open; maintenance needed to help me get in. Supposedly it sometimes acts up. Variety of eateries in the area almost walkable but uncertain of the safety of the area after dark. It seemed pretty isolated though there is a shopping center across the street about a half mile walk and restaurants in Piedmont Circle again another half mile. Front desk was less than helpful in recommending a place. Again nothing wrong with the hotel but there are others i the area that I might consider next trip,Daveyk14,Steamboat Springs Colorado,,34 reviews,Stayed February 2016 travelled on business

It is very close to the shopping mall and has a number of dining options. It is also just a 20 minute drive to Uptown. The property has done a good job at updating their decor. It was vibrant and had a CHIC feel. However the service was poor. There are many opportunities for improvement. There were hiccups during check-in and I also overheard a staff member speaking to another guest in a way that was not professional. The housekeeping staff did not come to service our room until nearly 6pm one night which is unacceptable. I also observed stains on the bed linens the toilet worked poorly and toiletries in the bathroom that were used (ex: lotion bottle was nearly empty--everything should have been brand new and unused). The property needs to do a much better job on the service aspect all around. Again the location was great but factoring in everything else I do not desire to return to this property. I was really disappointed to see that a Renaissance/Marriott property was being managed and serviced this way.,Dynamitetravel,Maitland Florida,,162 reviews,Stayed May 2015 travelled on business

(There are two other hotels closer but this one turned out to be fine even though we did have to drive across the street and find a place to park. That area is not pedestrian friendly.) The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful and the check in was quick and easy. Our room was fairly large with two queen extremely comfortable beds with duvets and down pillows. The bathroom was large enough for two and the shower had a very nice waterfall showerhead. There were plenty of fluffy towels and lots of toiletries and they gladly gave us toothpaste when we realized we had forgotten ours. I was excited to find a lighted magnifying mirror in the bathroom but it was too close to the side wall so it ended up being fairly unusable. Besides the mirror in the bathroom there was only another one in the hallway (closet door) with no outlet nearby which made it difficult for two women in the bathroom trying to dry straighten and curl their hair. As with almost every hotel I have ever stayed in there are not enough reachable outlets for hair appliances or the many electronics (phones cameras iPods laptops) that have to be charged at night. Also the level of lighting is on the dim side and for those of us of middle age and older this can make reading difficult. One thing that was noticeably missing was information on area restaurants. The only info we could find was about the hotel restaurant. One other minus was the level of noise from the hall. People talking while walking down the hall sounded like they could be in the room with us. It didn't bother me because I always travel with earplugs! Overall the stay while short was very comfortable and pleasant. Next time we visit Charlotte though we will probably stay in a downtown hotel because other than shopping at the mall there isn't much to do in the SouthPark area.,Tarheel78,Hillsborough NC,,27 reviews,Stayed February 2008 travelled with family

Don't get excited! This Renaissance is a decent hotel in a nice area but is not "all new" as of February. The walls are thin (talking coughing and bathroom noises plainly heard) the halls smell of air freshener the furniture has dings the wallpaper has places where it is coming unglued. For the price and in that location you can do better. The courtyard restaurant looks attractive but no one seemed to eat there. It would be ideal for an Embassy Suites type free breakfast and "manager's reception" and that would make the hotel feel happier! There are no maps of the hotel anywhere. At one point an elderly lady and small children in bathing suits were wandering around the entry clearly lost. The front desk is understaffed. The staff are all nice-there just weren't very many! The windows are sealed which is an issue to me. On the good side there is plenty of free parking. The location is convenient to South Park Mall and the surrounding businesses. It is safe and the beds are very good. I would recommend the Marriott and the Residence Inn South Park ahead of this hotel for about the same dollar.,nonamesforme,minneapolis mn,,228 reviews,Stayed February 2008 travelled solo

Only other comment I would make to the hotel is after arriving later in the evening I found the hotel parking and outside to be quite dark with nothing available but a deck in the back. Due to this I opted for valet to avoid roaming around in the dark. I was glad this service was available.,nancy h,Raleigh North Carolina,,41 reviews,Stayed August 2015 travelled on business

The location of the Renaissance was perfect and the stay was wonderful! We are very impressed with the hotel! The staff was extremely welcoming and asked the girls about their dolls. The bellman in the elevator were very friendly and even talked to the girls about their dolls as well. He helped my daughter pick her stuff up when she dumped her suitcase over accidentally in the hall while getting out of the elevator. The parking was a little frustrating once coming back late from the mall on Saturday night but I managed to find a place on the top of the deck. The pool was average a little confusing the find. We walked the hall that leads to the pool 3 times trying to locate it after seeing the pool arrow sign. The sign lead down the hall and all you found was the fitness center door plaque. The plaque doesn't inform you the pool is through the fitness center. We walked up and down the hall for a good 10 minutes trying to find it and finally just went to the front desk and asked them. They informed us we needed to go through fitness center (something all the wall beside fitness center would have been nice). The fire alarm went off while we were getting out of the pool so we had to evacuate the hotel (while still soaking wet) outside in the cold. The staff were very helpful getting everyone out of the building - thankfully it wasn't an actual fire and we weren't outside long. The room was very clean and nice. The room service staff who brought our breakfast were very friendly. I do not like that you have to pay for WiFi. This is provided for free in most hotels now just not at the Renaissance.

But Marriott has done wonders in renovating and making it their own. Hotel is right across the street from Southpark Mall some of the best shopping in Charlotte. The staff at the front desk is wonderful and called me by name every time I'd walk past. Rooms are spotless and there's no sign of The Hyatt Touch.

I know that area well but had never stayed at this property. When I checked in I went to my room and noticed a musty/mildew smell. I returned to the front desk with my luggage in tow and asked that I be moved to a different room. The front desk attendant was cordial and apologetic and changed my room. When I went up to the second room I found the same problem - musty/mildew smell. When I changed from the first room to the second one the attendant told me that the hotel was sold out but fortunately they had a room they could put me in. When I discovered the second room had the same smell I began to think that it might be more of a hotel issue than an individual room problem. I checked availability of the Marriott hotel located very near the Renaissance and found that they had availability. I returned to the front desk and asked that I be checked out of the hotel as I would be moving over to the Marriott. The front desk clerk told me that the Marriott was sold out and that I would not be able to get a room there - despite what I saw online. She even called the Marriott and they told her that they did not have any availability. She told me that most hotels in the city were sold out for the night and that I would be best to stay at the Renaissance. I went over to the hotel's guest computer and logged into my Marriott account and easily made a reservation at the Southpark Marriott.

We stayed here at the Renaissance SouthPark. The staff was immediately very friendly and wished him a happy birthday. We were offered complimentary champagne upon arrival. Everybody was just very polite and inviting. Our room was awesome! We got the king executive suite. We ended up not really using the suite area though because we went to dinner and got back late. If I had to do it all over again I might just get the standard king room. We did get the club level which was very worth it for the included breakfast. It was absolutely outstanding!! Great variety of all sorts of foods including some healthy. The workout gym was great too...we were offered complimentary fresh-fruit water and handed towels during the workout!

Amelia Gustafson was EXTREMELY helpful from ensuring that everything was perfect for our American Girl package to even helping me find a restaurant for dinner! Amazingly friendly and helpful you have a very special lady in her! I was so upset that she had left for the day upon our check in as I looked so forward to meeting her!

The first one being the Marriott Grande Dunes in Myrtle Beach. When we checked in the front desk clerk was great. She had a great smile and her personality was outstanding. She asked for my last name and because I was a Marriott Reward Customer everything was taken care of and she just handed me my room key. I had a room booked on the Club Level so the clerk took the time to walk with me to show where the elevator and the room where breakfast will be served. In the lobby they had chocolate candy and drinks because of Valentine's day. I forgot to mention they had miniture cupcakes. The room was very clean and smelled good. The bed was ohhh so comfortable and they have great showerheads (always a plus for me). We booked the couple's package and had wine chocolate covered strawberries and pretzels delivered to our room. The breakfast the next morning was great! Even though I live 20 minutes from Charlotte this place will be my little secret getaway when I don't want to travel far.

The hotel was clean and bed bug free. The staff was courteous helpful and the room well maintained. The only criticism we can make is for some reason they pump a rather strong fragrance thru the air vents.

Apparently they have recently renovated its a beautiful hotel. The beds and linens are top of the line my grandkids even raved about them!! Some confusion with check-in and our key cards didn't work but I think our person was new. LOTS of personnel working the front counter (all women) but if you walk in wearing jeans after driving 6 hours you will feel out of place in comparison and by their "looks" toward you. (I may look frazzled ladies but my cash is going toward your wages!) These same women take your room service orders and forward them to the kitchen - what a fiasco! It took 3 phone calls and 3 trips to our room before everyone got their breakfast order and even then we were shorted on 2 settings of silverware - I didn't dare call again. Again this is a lovely hotel and if you always dress to the 9's you will be treated warmly. I would definitely stay here again (and probably wear my most rumpled outfit with uncombed hair to hear these Ivanka Trump wannabes gasp in unison as I enter their establishment.)

We went to this hotel for 2 weekends back to back.. First stay was ok .. The room was ok .. Beds comfy defiantly needed a good cleaning .. Just over looked the whole stay ... I get home and I had forgotten my fit bit in the room .. I called as soon as I got home .... I called and left 3 messages for the manager of housekeeping ... I still have not heard back from him.. Ok so after calling and asking the front desk about my loss they still transfer me to the manager of housekeeping ... He still has not called me back .. All I want is an answer do they have my fit bit??? Yes or no... So a lady in housekeeping Jessie called me back all I asked was where is my fit bit I really could not understand what the big deal is .. Just call me back .. Ok so I just checked out today .. Face to face conversation where is my fit bit ??? They look at each other and still the answer is that they really have not looked till today ... I showed the lady a photo of what we are missing ... I really try my hardest to be positive about my stay .. I am loyal to this hotel when in the area.. I am only wanting a straight answer .... The whole stay was off ... Under staffed and never the same people to help...... The room we stayed in smelled like cigarettes .... Now my suite case smells and everything smells like cigarettes ..

The location near shopping and restaurants is fabulous and the hotel is a very satisfactory choice for a weekend in Charlotte. This time we were in a corner king room which was spacious comfortable and quiet. The common areas of the hotel are very open which gives it an energetic feel that I don't find particularly appealing but with all of the wonderful things nearby to experience this isn't a hotel you'd spend the day hanging around the lobby in anyway.

I know that area well but had never stayed at this property. When I checked in I went to my room and noticed a musty/mildew smell. I returned to the front desk with my luggage in tow and asked that I be moved to a different room. The front desk attendant was cordial and apologetic and changed my room. When I went up to the second room I found the same problem - musty/mildew smell. When I changed from the first room to the second one the attendant told me that the hotel was sold out but fortunately they had a room they could put me in. When I discovered the second room had the same smell I began to think that it might be more of a hotel issue than an individual room problem. I checked availability of the Marriott hotel located very near the Renaissance and found that they had availability. I returned to the front desk and asked that I be checked out of the hotel as I would be moving over to the Marriott. The front desk clerk told me that the Marriott was sold out and that I would not be able to get a room there - despite what I saw online. She even called the Marriott and they told her that they did not have any availability. She told me that most hotels in the city were sold out for the night and that I would be best to stay at the Renaissance. I went over to the hotel's guest computer and logged into my Marriott account and easily made a reservation at the Southpark Marriott. I then called the hotel to confirm that they had received my reservation and that a room was available. No issues - so I'm not sure why the Renaissance clerk was so adamant that I stay at the Renaissance! Maybe I caught the hotel on a bad night - and maybe I was checked into the only two rooms with a smell issue.....but I can't help to think that there's more to the story and I'm glad I didn't have to stay to find out how much more!,StevenVA,Chesterfield Virginia,Room Tip: Pass by this hotel and get a reservation at the Southpark Marriott!

The company I worked for at the time had a contract with Hyatt and this is where I stayed. So imagine my surprise when I arrived and found out this was my old home away from home. But Marriott has done wonders in renovating and making it their own. Hotel is right across the street from Southpark Mall some of the best shopping in Charlotte. The staff at the front desk is wonderful and called me by name every time I'd walk past. Rooms are spotless and there's no sign of The Hyatt Touch. I highly recommend as a great place to stay.,romadaro,Washington DC,,771 reviews,Stayed March 2014 travelled on business

We travel often and we've stayed at numerous Marriott properties in various states but this is absolutely one of the best we've seen to date. The outside of the property looks very nice and it's located directly across the street from South Park Mall so it has that kind of upscale feel to it. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered the building and were greeted with the nicest scent... this hotel smells really nice inside! I know that sounds like a strange comment to make for a hotel but we've stayed at many hotels in the Marriott chain that smell nice at the lobby and then smell a little musty and damp when you actually go on room floors. This one had the most pleasant smell from the time you walked in the door all the way through the hallways (even upstairs) and into the room. Very very nice way to greet your guests. The staff were wonderful and got us checked in quickly and efficiently. We were also very pleased with the room we had. We stayed in the Executive King Suite and it was very roomy for the two of us. Nice to see hardwood (laminate?) floors in a hotel room gave the place a very upscale feel. Love the Presidential Collection bathrobe in the room as well!

I was impressed with the friendly helpful staff and the hotel is beautiful. We had a room with an indoor balcony. This was great for my kids because they were spending a lot of time in the room with grandma while I was away for a business meeting. The indoor pool is nice as well. The rooms are very clean and well maintained. No issues at all. The lounge area is lovely and worked well for business travel and meetings. The funky chairs are great!

The public areas are very nice but the rooms are not very special or quiet. During my last visit there were wedding receptions occurring downstairs (Saturday stay) & some family groups on the 5th floor were going back & forth to different rooms slamming doors and talking loudly. If it hadn't been so late (& I wasn't in my pj's) I would have requested another room. Instead I had to listen to various noises coming from the room next door and in the hallway. If you avoid visiting on the weekend you'll probably enjoy your stay. I didn't enjoy mine though.,denyseminer,Boone North Carolina,Room Tip: Request a room at the end of the hall or bring ear plugs because the doors slam shut.

It's a short distance from downtown and has great dining options nearby if you don't want to drive for dinner. I arrived ~11pm on a Monday night. Parking is free near the hotel or in it's covered garage. The hotel checkin staff were pleasant and welcomed me to the hotel. After finding out about my Marriott status she perked up even more and advised I had been upgraded to "her favorite Executive King room". The room itself was very nice. Hardwood floors a big couch and chair a huge king bed and a big closet and bathroom. The bathroom was rather small but serviceable. The hotel has a concierge lounge with some of the more pleasant hotel staff you will find. The space was big and had plenty of room to sit. Breakfast consisted of breads eggs cereal oatmeal grits sausage and bacon. The fridge had plenty of yogurt milk and water. Plenty of juice and coffee was available too. For dinner/dessert they had a variety of goodies all week. Mostly finger foods but tasty ones. Dessert varied as well with cookies and bread pudding. One evening I used the bar to have a few drinks. The bar gets pretty lively and the staff was very good. They even featured beer flights! The area has a ton of restaurants to eat including a chain tavern that the staff seemed overly pushy about.

We got room service twice here and it was delicious both times. Beds were comfortable and the restroom was clean and well laid out. We had two doubles and the linens were especially soft as were the pillows. My only complaint was parking but this was in part due to the holiday season I'm sure. We had to circle a few times and wait for someone to pull out which was inconvenient with a 6 month old who was ready to get out of the car after a day of driving. It was frustrating to be turned away from an almost entirely empty lot with cones around it because we didn't want to pay for valet. Oh well we sorted it out!

It has a nice hip vibe without going too far. The bed was divine plush super comfortable.

Let me first say the hotel was great and the staff was wonderful. However be wary of the Events Manager. We thought she was wonderful and was going to take great care of us and our guest. We made two specific trips to the hotel as we also are from out of town to meet with the Event Manager and to ensure we had all necessary arrangments made. We had a simple request to ensure all of our guest who booked in the room block we arranged would be on the same floor as we the hosts would be. Two primary purposes so that it would be conveninet for them to enjoy the hospitality room we were hosting and to ensure we did not distrurb other hotel guests who were not part of our group with noise from our celebration. We also had the bride to be staying in the hotel and wanted to ensure she stayed in a room away from all other guests to ensure her privacy and ability to rest well the night before the wedding. Word of caution. If you use this hotel be sure the Event Manager passes all the arrangements you make to athe appropriate hotel stay for execution. Despite the planning the Event Manager never passed the information to the front desk. Totally dropped the ball. We should have suspected something was wrong when we checked in. The front desk was clueless to the arrangments made for our rooms and hospitality room. All of our guest were placed on a different floor then we were and in fact were on the same floor as the bride to be! All had a good time but what a disappointment. And all the hotel had to say was sorry. Sure we received a personal phone call from the Events Manager explaining what happened offering an apology. But that was it. Essentially we're sorry but too bad too sad. They had are money (of course you have to pay in advance).

The entire property is meticulous and the decor is first rate. The king bed room was beautiful and all furnishings were stylish new looking clean and comfortable. They use Aveda products in the bathroom which are really nice. While we did not eat there this time on earlier occasions the food was wonderful. On check-in there were complimentary chocolate covered strawberries and champagne for guests! There is a gorgeous courtyard in the back that features fire pits and comfortable seating.

When I arrived at the Renaissance I was greeted by a lovely concierge (wish I could remember his name). He assisted me with parking while I went inside to check in. He made some comment about me being from Wisconsin (after noticing my license plates and EXTREMELY dirty car - hey ... roadtrips will do that to your car). He followed that comment up by letting me know that the Green Bay Packers choose to stay at the same hotel (go me!) - which was an ego boost for me as they are my FAVORITE team ever!! Plus we clearly have good taste haha. Check in was a breeze! I was at the counter for all of 5 minutes and they gave me a quick tour of the ground level. I was able to park my vehicle in the garage and unload my luggage. My only complaint - NO ELEVATOR! (I apologize if I'm wrong - but I swear I didn't see one!). Granted this is a parking garage - but I packed clothes for a week which means by women's standards there were enough clothes in there to last me a month... and I DONT work out. Just sayin! The hotel itself... now this is going to sound weird... the hotel smelled so good! I don't know what they pump into the air but I'm telling you - it's heavenly! My room was extremely clean and well kept. Shower was spacious and the bed (king size) was super comfortable. The staff was very helpful in recommending restaurants and shopping areas of interest. Noise level was minimum - the walls must be well insulated and the doors must be thick enough - or I just had the most quiet neighbors ever!

The hotel is beautiful and offers many lounging areas. The infused water and mini desserts or a nice treat upon arrival. The room was nice and clean and the bed was comfortable. However I don't recommend ordering breakfast unless you specify exactly how you like everything cooked. The scrambled eggs were super wet and the hashbrowns were too. The little packets of butter were liquid because it was wrapped on the top of my toast. The bacon was to my liking but if you like it crisper you'll need to specify.

Our problem got resolved because a woman standing next to us over heard the conversation and offered to take a king room and give us her room that had two beds.

Great location for shopping and many wonderful restaurants within walking distance. Their are many different sizes of rooms to choose from. We stayed in a corner room that was quite nice. Larger than the side rooms. The rooms are very nicely decorated with attention paid to detail. Very clean and comfortable! The lobby is very inviting in bright colors and it opens up into a beautiful atrium with small bar. Their is also a restaurant that serves breakfast and it was very good!! We also enjoyed sitting outside in their courtyard area. Very comfortable seating trees with lights and fire pits. A great place to sit chat and have a drink. Although we weren't there long enough to use but their is a very nice pool area and a nice workout room. We definitely will stay at the Marriott again. Very pleased!,suegirlnc,Conover North Carolina,,82 reviews,Stayed October 2015

I am a very frequent business traveler and maintain silver elite status with them. They told me that as I had prepaid they were not "able" to change it and the money I spent was forfeited - even though they had plenty of space. Simple remedy booked with DoubleTree next door that has a much more flexible change/cancellation policy.

Amelia Gustafson was EXTREMELY helpful from ensuring that everything was perfect for our American Girl package to even helping me find a restaurant for dinner! Amazingly friendly and helpful you have a very special lady in her! I was so upset that she had left for the day upon our check in as I looked so forward to meeting her!

The Starwood equivalent might be a cross-section of Sheratons AND Westins. This property is at the "average" end of the spectrum. The lobby was interesting sort of several different areas that created a warren-like effect. That opened up into a wider area where the bar and restaurant were. I had a corner king room which was fine. The bathroom was standard there was a mini fridge and a microwave. When the closet doors were open you couldn't want around them into the main room. There was nothing really to complain about but nothing that made me want to go out of my way to stay there again.

We explained that we were not interested in sharing a king size bed. They told us there was nothing they could do. Never offered to check another hotel. Our problem got resolved because a woman standing next to us over heard the conversation and offered to take a king room and give us her room that had two beds. She had already been in her room but was more than happy to help us. Front desk staff seemed "put out" because now they had to switch guest information between the rooms.

It was above average both times. The bellman/doorman Danny is excellent and went out of his way both trips to help us with our belongings and find places we wanted to go. The rooms are nice and clean. The indoor pool is well maintained but could be warmer (it was a little too cold) to be honest. The restaurant is average but decent. The front desk staff is also really nice and the hotel is located within walking distance ego great eateries. The lobby is a little humid with all the indoor ponds but otherwise a good stay both times.,Emma M,Metairie Louisiana,,5 reviews,Stayed December 2013 travelled on business

First off let me say that the first person that I met as I pulled up to the hotel was the bellman Danny very nice and respectful and most of all helpful and kind. He helped me with my luggage from the car to my room. Amy and Raina at the front desk were always very helpful every time I needed something. I had been dealing with Jenni in events leading up to my arrival to the hotel and she was always more than helpful quick to respond to all of my requests via phone or email. Just the best! James in banquet catering and his staff (Jason and Kevin) were also amazing I never was in need or want for anything. They really made sure that all of the members of the company were well taken care of. Regina Carlos Danielle and Jeffrey the servers and bartenders were also always on point if one of our meetings ended early they quickly adjusted so that we never ever had to wait for a meal or snack or coffee break. Jessica and Lisa in reservations were also amazing and patient we had to make so many changes and additions to the room reservations and they always were willing and able and quick to make the necessary changes. All in all our event was a total success because of the AMAZING staff at this hotel. I would advise anyone looking to hold a corporate event wedding party etc. to look into this hotel you will not be disappointed.

Was here as opposed to the South Park Marriott and the Double Tree owing to high demand at those hotels on this particular trip. Check-in was very fast and efficient. The public areas are wonderfully appointed and quite inviting. My room was on the fourh floor and although it was right near the elevator I barely noticed any of the sounds that you usually hear in a elevator common area. Sleep quality was better than most hotels Ive stayed at with a generous amount of pillows and comfortable sheets and mattress. The bathroom actually had a decent bath tub which I like and the lighting was ample. Concierge service was helpful - guiding us to not only a good restaurant experience but also arranging for a car service for us to the CLT airport.

She heightened the experience with an up grade. She later shared her expertise for activities and sight seeing excursions which were magnificent.The Club Level provided several amenities and Room 601 was prepared in Immaculate fashion. Danny's job description is Bellman/Doorman; however his energy passion and genuine warmth has made him a solid friend. He was available with expert suggestions for trips through his knowledge of the community. All staff members were kind and helpful with an inviting smile.

They lack a lot of amenities for a so called upscale hotel. Their breakfast buffet is a joke.

I was worried about the bed because I am pregnant and I forgot my body pillow. The bed pillows and bedding were so comfortable that I didn't even need the body pillow. We both slept very well. The room itself was nicely decorated as well. There were limited edition prints on the walss and the furniture seemed to be updated. We had a room with a balcony over the resteraunt but we were only in town for the night so we really didn't have time to enjoy it though. It did get a bit noisy during the night being so close to the bar though. I rated the sleep comfort at 4 out of 5 rather than five because of the noise. We opted for room service for breakfast rather than eating downstairs for breakfast. The delivery was prompt but the server forgot our juice. He did bring it up right away after we pointed it out though. The check-in and check-out experience was pleasant and the staff was friendly. If I were to visit Charlotte again I would stay here again.,Mountains2Seas,Virginia,,3 reviews,Stayed March 2010 travelled as a couple

We're GOOD sleepers- we can sleep about anywhere anytime through all sort of noise. So it's really something for me to have to write that we were unable to sleep here. Tossed and turned all night. Thank goodness for the fitness center and pool! The beds were hard and the pillows way too think- it felt like my head was at a right angle. Great for propping yourself up to watch TV but not to actually sleep on- that's two different types of pillows. Look elsewhere if you have even remote trouble getting good sleep. Otherwise friendly staff and nice list of amenities but unfortunately I had to rate them low because a hotel should prioritize for sleep!,trippernipperquipper,appalachia,,1 review,Stayed March 2010 travelled with friends

My husband and I stayed here this past weekend for a romantic get-away. The location is great as we wanted to be near great food and shopping. Our room was at the end of the hall so we were not bothered by much noise. The hotel is in need of interior updates. Dining and room service leave much to be desired. Pros: - Great location for shopping and restaurants. - The valet service was extremely courteous and efficient. - Bar tender was very pleasant. - When a second robe was requested it was delivered within minutes. - Beds are extremely comfortable. - Room furnishings were ample. Cons: - Skip the hotel breakfast. We sat for 10 minutes before a server acknowledged us and took our drink order. I passed on the mediocre looking buffet and opted for a made to order omelet. I was given the wrong omelet and the server never checked back with us. Even though we purchased breakfast for two days with our room we skipped it the second day. - Furnishing in the bar need replaced. All of the bar stools were scratched up and felt like they were about to fall apart. - The second morning of our stay we opted for coffee juice and bagels in our room. We placed our breakfast card on the door at 11 PM (cut-off is 2 AM) and no one picked it up. However someone did make a point of dropping off our bill. When my husband went downstairs to get some coffee he heard another guest complaining about the exact same thing. Apparently the person responsible for picking up breakfast cards was a no-show. I would think that the person who dropped off the bills would have noticed the oversight and communicated to management that breakfast cards were not picked up. If it wasn't for the poor breakfast and in-room dining service I probably would have rated my experience as Very Good.

I have to say that this hotel has THE most comfortable beds that I have been in. The rooms are absolutely huge and have a nice real hardwood entrance with newly decorated interiors. The floor that I was on was considered the "concierge" floor that provided upgraded ammenities (AVEDA toiletries that were replenished daily) and complimentary bottled water (that they did not replenish during my stay). The room also had a mini-fridge. The people that work at this hotel are top notch. From the valet who was personable and funny as all get out (I didn't park my car but was dropped off and he opened my door) to the front desk gal (who in the morning arranged for a car service to take me to the airport) to the guy that opens the door for you when you walk in and out - the service was TOP NOTCH. I would recommend this hotel for a business or leisure traveler. Make sure you ask for a corporate rate if you are traveling on business. There are a ton of restaurants around this area that while aren't really walking distance when its cold (maybe 1/2 mile at the most) are certainly convenient. There is also a mall right across the street. Airport is about 15-20 minutes away.,AK L,United States,,43 reviews,Stayed February 2010 travelled on business

This place is the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in. The best beds BY FAR. I just couldn't get over it. I had to sort of learn how to do this hotel. Check in was smooth. They were able to give us adjoining rooms. One had two queen beds and one had a great king....the rooms were more than adequately sized and very comfortable. The decor is odd but very comfortable and I like bright colors (good thing). Great big screen HD TV's and all the electronic stuff to go with it...also internet access etc. Very nice bath with premium towels. Coffee in room but under cabinet....plenty of electrical outlets. Wall Street Journals in the lobby and USA Today in the elevator landings. The fitness area was supurb and again immaculate. Initially I was a little put off by the restaurant. We were all going down for breakfast and I thought to myself that it was way overpriced...so we went to the Original Waffle House down the street a little (excellent really). I reviewed it a little more though and it was really more how the menu was presented not nearly as bad as I thought at first. I also didn't understand how they could charge ($1.50) for a cup of coffee (I sort of was looking for a cup very early without wanting to go in....) but I broke down and got one and considering all the value I was getting elsewhere it was OK. We did go in for breakfast eventually and it was reasonable as long as you shopped the menu a little and the Chef was on scene and was very concerned we were happy. We order continental breakfast and it was extensive...again more the I expected and a delight. Perfectly located across from the deluxe Southpark Mall. (Nordstrom etc) LOTS of restaurants close by. Parking mystified me a little at first but there is a parking garage adjoining the hotel in the rear very convenient. My son lost his phone and we didn't realize it until after we left. We went back to get it....and thinking they wouldn't try hard enough to find it I went upstairs on my own initiative...the head of housekeeping and the room attendent were down on the floor on their hands and knees looking for it. Way above the call of duty and I think this is the way the whole place is run.,BobWFlorida,Florida,,9 reviews,Stayed June 2009 travelled with family

This place is the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in. The best beds BY FAR. I just couldn't get over it. I had to sort of learn how to do this hotel. Check in was smooth. They were able to give us adjoining rooms. One had two queen beds and one had a great king....the rooms were more than adequately sized and very comfortable. The decor is odd but very comfortable and I like bright colors (good thing). Great big screen HD TV's and all the electronic stuff to go with it...also internet access etc. Very nice bath with premium towels. Coffee in room but under cabinet....plenty of electrical outlets. Wall Street Journals in the lobby and USA Today in the elevator landings. The fitness area was supurb and again immaculate. Initially I was a little put off by the restaurant. We were all going down for breakfast and I thought to myself that it was way overpriced...so we went to the Original Waffle House down the street a little (excellent really). I reviewed it a little more though and it was really more how the menu was presented not nearly as bad as I thought at first. I also didn't understand how they could charge ($1.50) for a cup of coffee (I sort of was looking for a cup very early without wanting to go in....) but I broke down and got one and considering all the value I was getting elsewhere it was OK. We did go in for breakfast eventually and it was reasonable as long as you shopped the menu a little and the Chef was on scene and was very concerned we were happy. We order continental breakfast and it was extensive...again more the I expected and a delight. Perfectly located across from the deluxe Southpark Mall. (Nordstrom etc) LOTS of restaurants close by. Parking mystified me a little at first but there is a parking garage adjoining the hotel in the rear very convenient. My son lost his phone and we didn't realize it until after we left. We went back to get it....and thinking they wouldn't try hard enough to find it I went upstairs on my own initiative...the head of housekeeping and the room attendent were down on the floor on their hands and knees looking for it. Way above the call of duty and I think this is the way the whole place is run.,BobWFlorida,Florida,,9 reviews,Stayed June 2009 travelled with family

The staff is beyond helpfull and friendly it's a case where the lovely Southern hospitality meets the Renaissance way of hosting delighted to serve. Everything is impecable clean the hotel smelled like mink. The amenities are Aveda and are pretty good I didn't need to use any personal toilletries items. The hotel bar is also very good. It's across the street from Charlotte's Southpark mall. The fitness center is small but efficent and my only concern of the whole hotel is the fitness center bathroom floods while you are taking a shower what can be pretty incovenient. And I've also missed a breakfast buffet during the week. It's great value I highly recommend it and I'd stay over there again how many times were necessary.,chardecara,Sao Paulo SP,,35 reviews,Stayed June 2014 travelled on business

It is a beautiful property in a super nice South Park location. The upscale South Park Mall is nearby and there are several good restaurants in the area. We were met by Danny at the door the first day and he was so helpful all three days we stayed in the hotel. He is most definitely an asset to this hotel....friendly and fun! The front desk staff was always helpful and gave us several good recommendations for restaurants. Everyone is very very friendly greeting each guest passing through the front lobby. The other doormen we met were also very helpful and we felt pampered! The room we had (601) had a not-so-great view of the parking deck but it was very quiet. Room decor is contemporary bright colors....I guess you could say a 'happy look'. Bedding is very comfortable and you get a robe (we had to ask for an extra one) just like at the JW Marriotts. Bath products are by Aveda and smell wonderful! There is a mini fridge and a coffee maker hair dryer and a magnifying mirror (yay!). Rooms were very clean and housekeeping came promptly and made up the room each day. We were given plenty of towels during the three days there. We paid extra for the concierge floor package which included free breakfast in the club room and internet. The breakfasts were actually pretty nice....eggs breads lots of fresh fruit oatmeal juice and brewed Starbucks coffee. There were often snacks in the lobby and one day we had champagne and delicious chocolates! Parking is free and that is definitely a plus over the downtown hotels in Charlotte. I would say it's worth it to pay a little more to have the free internet and club lounge breakfasts. We didn't use it (no time!) but checked out the pool and fitness area....there is also a dry sauna. Everything looked clean and inviting. You won't be sorry if you choose this hotel in Charlotte. We would recommend it to anyone!,chriss j,Bloomfield Hills Michigan,Room Tip: 601 was quiet but didn't have a good view. Next time I would ask for a King room with a nice v...

The front desk service was friendly and welcoming at check-in (I think his name was Pete). Each afternoon there were complementary beverages in the lobby including merlot the first day and champagne the second. The Renaissance is a beautiful hotel especially the first floor lobby area. Perhaps because the weather was a bit on the cool side the hallways and bar/restaurant seemed quite cold... especially as you walk from the hallway into the elevator lobby on the fourth floor. The blast of air from above was annoying. There is a nice size fitness room with five treadmills and several elliptical machines. I never had trouble getting a machine in the morning. One minor quibble... the TVs didn't seem to work on all the treadmills or perhaps I just couldn't figure out how to make them work! There was a small pool (which we didn't use) and a large atrium with rocking chairs (which we did use). We had a large corner room (454) with two comfortable armchairs a hassock and a coffee table... perfect for two people. We like that the room was at the end of the hall especially since there were some noisy people on our floor the second night of our stay... including some bozo who accidentally sent Champagne and chocolate covered pretzels to our room at 11:00 PM. I was a little annoyed that the room service waiter did not apologize for the late night intrusion... he just sort of backed away and left. Room service for breakfast was tasty and I thought reasonably priced for room service. I probably would have added a tip to the bill but there was no space to do so... may I suggest modifying the printout to allow for that option when service is especially good? The Renaissance is located in a great area with many restaurants and Charlotte's upscale Southpark mall. As I mentioned above we like this hotel better than any others we've tried in Charlotte including most recently the Hyatt House Charlotte/Center City and the Ballantyne Hotel. We will definitely be back.,Brian M,Herndon Virginia,,221 reviews,Stayed May 2014 travelled as a couple

It is very close to the shopping mall and has a number of dining options. It is also just a 20 minute drive to Uptown. The property has done a good job at updating their decor. It was vibrant and had a CHIC feel. However the service was poor. There are many opportunities for improvement. There were hiccups during check-in and I also overheard a staff member speaking to another guest in a way that was not professional. The housekeeping staff did not come to service our room until nearly 6pm one night which is unacceptable.

Usually Aveda products and I have not seen one that was not clean. I work with Hotels in a round about way so I look at carpets ceilings etc. so there may have been a couple of issues.

The rooms are very big and very clean. All the staff members that I interacted with were very friendly and very helpful. I ate dinner at the hotel 2 of the three nights and the food was very good. The hotel is in a central location which is close to the Uptown area and also close enough to the business parks on the outer parts of the City. The South Park area is a very nice area with a lot of upscale shopping and places to eat. It's a nice area to walk around both during the day and at night.

My other half and I were in town for one night and elected to stay at the Renaissance because comfort was the priority. We'd driven for a good part of the day- and were very pleased to be greeted warmly by the staff. Our check-in was quick and we were able to get comfy in lightening speed time. Our room was up to the typical standards of other Renaissance hotels we've stayed at around the country-beautiful décor a comfortable bed and an awesome shower. And it was also in a fabulous location there were a lot of great places to eat and shop in walking distance. Next time we plan to stay here a few nights to explore the area. The deco was absolutely beautiful in the lobby and other common areas. The outdoor lounge area was very tasteful and the gym was just right..cardio and strength training equipment as well. The parking is a little odd...some parking in the front and on the sides but the majority of it is behind the hotel in a garage…. but it connects to the back of the hotel and it was free!! Which isn't always the case at the high-end Marriott hotels. In Atlanta we pay $30.00 per night for parking at the “W” and Ritz and this hotel was comparable to both. The bar was great and I was able to get a night cap from a friendly barkeep. I'd definitely stay again..it was exactly what we needed after a long day and an impending early start.,Mimi823,Brecksville Ohio,Room Tip: Wine list offered several great ecletic wines...

Danny one of the hotel staff members was extremely helpful and caring. He took a personal interest in our satisfaction with the hotel. After talking with him on several occasions he remembered when we arrived and knew when we were leaving offered suggestions of things to do in the area and was just an outstanding person. We could tell he had a big caring heart and he made a lasting impression with us from our visit. I have never written a hotel review before but this experience so moved us that we had to mention it to other travelers. Oh...and by the way the hotel room was wonderful.

We went to this hotel for 2 weekends back to back.. First stay was ok .. The room was ok .. Beds comfy defiantly needed a good cleaning .. Just over looked the whole stay ... I get home and I had forgotten my fit bit in the room .. I called as soon as I got home .... I called and left 3 messages for the manager of housekeeping ... I still have not heard back from him.. Ok so after calling and asking the front desk about my loss they still transfer me to the manager of housekeeping ... He still has not called me back .. All I want is an answer do they have my fit bit??? Yes or no... So a lady in housekeeping Jessie called me back all I asked was where is my fit bit I really could not understand what the big deal is .. Just call me back .. Ok so I just checked out today .. Face to face conversation where is my fit bit ??? They look at each other and still the answer is that they really have not looked till today ... I showed the lady a photo of what we are missing ... I really try my hardest to be positive about my stay .. I am loyal to this hotel when in the area.. I am only wanting a straight answer .... The whole stay was off ... Under staffed and never the same people to help...... The room we stayed in smelled like cigarettes .... Now my suite case smells and everything smells like cigarettes ..

We went to this hotel for 2 weekends back to back.. First stay was ok .. The room was ok .. Beds comfy defiantly needed a good cleaning .. Just over looked the whole stay ... I get home and I had forgotten my fit bit in the room .. I called as soon as I got home .... I called and left 3 messages for the manager of housekeeping ... I still have not heard back from him.. Ok so after calling and asking the front desk about my loss they still transfer me to the manager of housekeeping ... He still has not called me back .. All I want is an answer do they have my fit bit??? Yes or no... So a lady in housekeeping Jessie called me back all I asked was where is my fit bit I really could not understand what the big deal is .. Just call me back .. Ok so I just checked out today .. Face to face conversation where is my fit bit ??? They look at each other and still the answer is that they really have not looked till today ... I showed the lady a photo of what we are missing ... I really try my hardest to be positive about my stay .. I am loyal to this hotel when in the area.. I am only wanting a straight answer .... The whole stay was off ... Under staffed and never the same people to help...... The room we stayed in smelled like cigarettes .... Now my suite case smells and everything smells like cigarettes ..

Marriott is my preference and of all Marriott properties I've ever stayed at (I'm a Gold Elite member at present) this one is the most wonderful. We ended up here because we were appalled by the Marriott Courtyard downtown when we arrived so we jumped in a cab and headed here. Boy we couldn't have been happier about that decision. $60 cheaper a night and worth three times more. First the renovations of the rooms are now complete so the previous reviewer's issue with renovations should be history. And as this is a family-owned Marriott (ie not a franchise) the renovation has spared no expense or attention to detail. In short the rooms are utterly gorgeous. And beds that put the normal (yet wonderful) Marriott Revive bedding package to shame - it was like sleeping on air. Very modern selection for colour scheme and the rooms were completely quiet - I didn't hear a single sound despite the property being at almost full occupancy. The concierge lounge is not yet renovated (although the plans look spectacular!) so they were offering free buffet breakfast to Gold Elite members in the restaurant instead. The buffet was not amongst the more lavish of the Marriott spreads but it was still very nice with fresh omelettes made to order and a decent selection of accompaniments - bacon sausage potatoes fruit baked goods cereal....and of course the always present JW Marriott oatmeal! The location is not downtown - it's about a $25-30 cab ride into the city. But it's directly across the street from a very large shopping mall (South Park Mall) with department and specialty stores ranging from high end (Neiman Marcus Louis Vuitton) through to the normal mall fare (Dillards Macy's Gap Brookstone). There's also a Rite Aid within five minutes' walking distance so I felt the location catered particularly well for visitors both with and without cars. The staff and service - without exception (and we dealt with almost all of them during the four days of our stay) were second-to-none and that's saying something for Marriott where the standard is generally quite high. My colleague and I both commented that we'd never felt more welcome or "at home" at any hotel and we travel more than 120 nights a year around the world. We will be coming to Charlotte on a reasonably regular basis and cannot wait to return to this hotel. One word of caution: The restaurant and concierge lounge are being renovated between now and the end of the year so if this is an issue for you defer your stay until January 2009. But personally it wouldn't cause me a moment's hesitation - this place is pure gold. Enjoy!,antipodienne,Australia,,26 reviews,Stayed November 2008 travelled on business

(There are two other hotels closer but this one turned out to be fine even though we did have to drive across the street and find a place to park. That area is not pedestrian friendly.) The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful and the check in was quick and easy. Our room was fairly large with two queen extremely comfortable beds with duvets and down pillows. The bathroom was large enough for two and the shower had a very nice waterfall showerhead. There were plenty of fluffy towels and lots of toiletries and they gladly gave us toothpaste when we realized we had forgotten ours. I was excited to find a lighted magnifying mirror in the bathroom but it was too close to the side wall so it ended up being fairly unusable. Besides the mirror in the bathroom there was only another one in the hallway (closet door) with no outlet nearby which made it difficult for two women in the bathroom trying to dry straighten and curl their hair. As with almost every hotel I have ever stayed in there are not enough reachable outlets for hair appliances or the many electronics (phones cameras iPods laptops) that have to be charged at night. Also the level of lighting is on the dim side and for those of us of middle age and older this can make reading difficult. One thing that was noticeably missing was information on area restaurants. The only info we could find was about the hotel restaurant. One other minus was the level of noise from the hall. People talking while walking down the hall sounded like they could be in the room with us. It didn't bother me because I always travel with earplugs! Overall the stay while short was very comfortable and pleasant. Next time we visit Charlotte though we will probably stay in a downtown hotel because other than shopping at the mall there isn't much to do in the SouthPark area.,Tarheel78,Hillsborough NC,,27 reviews,Stayed February 2008 travelled with family

Parking is free near the hotel or in it's covered garage. The hotel checkin staff were pleasant and welcomed me to the hotel. After finding out about my Marriott status she perked up even more and advised I had been upgraded to "her favorite Executive King room". The room itself was very nice. Hardwood floors a big couch and chair a huge king bed and a big closet and bathroom. The bathroom was rather small but serviceable. The hotel has a concierge lounge with some of the more pleasant hotel staff you will find. The space was big and had plenty of room to sit. Breakfast consisted of breads eggs cereal oatmeal grits sausage and bacon. The fridge had plenty of yogurt milk and water. Plenty of juice and coffee was available too. For dinner/dessert they had a variety of goodies all week. Mostly finger foods but tasty ones. Dessert varied as well with cookies and bread pudding. One evening I used the bar to have a few drinks. The bar gets pretty lively and the staff was very good. They even featured beer flights! The area has a ton of restaurants to eat including a chain tavern that the staff seemed overly pushy about.

We wanted to get away for an evening so we stayed only 1 night before traveling on to another city (and another Marriott hotel). The location was perfect being close to a shopping mall with many different shops and restaurants to choose from. Although we did not take advantage of shopping at the mall we did however eat at a restaurant across the street which was within walking distance...a very user friendly location. We also enjoyed having a few cocktails/beverages at the hotel lobby bar. The room was clean and due to our Marriott member level we were upgraded to a suite which was very spacious and comfortable.

The location of the Renaissance was perfect and the stay was wonderful! We are very impressed with the hotel! The staff was extremely welcoming and asked the girls about their dolls. The bellman in the elevator were very friendly and even talked to the girls about their dolls as well. He helped my daughter pick her stuff up when she dumped her suitcase over accidentally in the hall while getting out of the elevator. The parking was a little frustrating once coming back late from the mall on Saturday night but I managed to find a place on the top of the deck. The pool was average a little confusing the find. We walked the hall that leads to the pool 3 times trying to locate it after seeing the pool arrow sign. The sign lead down the hall and all you found was the fitness center door plaque. The plaque doesn't inform you the pool is through the fitness center. We walked up and down the hall for a good 10 minutes trying to find it and finally just went to the front desk and asked them. They informed us we needed to go through fitness center (something all the wall beside fitness center would have been nice). The fire alarm went off while we were getting out of the pool so we had to evacuate the hotel (while still soaking wet) outside in the cold. The staff were very helpful getting everyone out of the building - thankfully it wasn't an actual fire and we weren't outside long. The room was very clean and nice. The room service staff who brought our breakfast were very friendly. I do not like that you have to pay for WiFi. This is provided for free in most hotels now just not at the Renaissance.

But all in all this was a wonderful first stay in Charlotte with close proximity to premiere shopping and restaurants and I will likely be a return guest.,David S,Reston Virginia,,1 review,Stayed February 2015 travelled as a couple

I know that area well but had never stayed at this property. When I checked in I went to my room and noticed a musty/mildew smell. I returned to the front desk with my luggage in tow and asked that I be moved to a different room. The front desk attendant was cordial and apologetic and changed my room. When I went up to the second room I found the same problem - musty/mildew smell. When I changed from the first room to the second one the attendant told me that the hotel was sold out but fortunately they had a room they could put me in. When I discovered the second room had the same smell I began to think that it might be more of a hotel issue than an individual room problem. I checked availability of the Marriott hotel located very near the Renaissance and found that they had availability. I returned to the front desk and asked that I be checked out of the hotel as I would be moving over to the Marriott. The front desk clerk told me that the Marriott was sold out and that I would not be able to get a room there - despite what I saw online. She even called the Marriott and they told her that they did not have any availability. She told me that most hotels in the city were sold out for the night and that I would be best to stay at the Renaissance. I went over to the hotel's guest computer and logged into my Marriott account and easily made a reservation at the Southpark Marriott. I then called the hotel to confirm that they had received my reservation and that a room was available. No issues - so I'm not sure why the Renaissance clerk was so adamant that I stay at the Renaissance! Maybe I caught the hotel on a bad night - and maybe I was checked into the only two rooms with a smell issue.....but I can't help to think that there's more to the story and I'm glad I didn't have to stay to find out how much more!,StevenVA,Chesterfield Virginia,Room Tip: Pass by this hotel and get a reservation at the Southpark Marriott!

From the moment I arrived (5:30am from a red eye) I was greeted by the morning front door man who immediately took my baggage under control and escorted me to the front desk where the young woman checked to see if there was any way I could check in (arrival time was for the afternoon). My type of room wasn't available but they set me up with my Executive passkey and sent me into the care of the dining room manager and staff who continued the same excellent care. Later during my stay Kat took great care of me at the bar (as a wine drinker I especially appreciated their use of nice stemware and the selection of excellent wines) and Danny always made me feel like I was staying with friends rather than at a generic hotel. The salt scrub in the downstairs bathroom is just one of the excellent "extra" touches that serves to elevate this hotel.

Danny is absolutely the warmest welcome you will find anywhere in town. He will go above and beyond to accommodate you as you arrive and make you feel like you are at home.

The entrance is very nice - lots of staff to help with bags and check in etc. The mall is across the street so that is convenient. The hallways and rooms are nicely finished. The rooms themselves are decent sized - not large but not small. The bathroom is a little cramped. It's fine for one person or two - gets tough if there are three or more. We had trouble getting the shower to work - called the desk - they were to send maintenance - but maintenance never showed up. I eventually discovered that a good whack fixed the problem.

Once they fill up it's a bit of a hike around the hotel to get to your car. They do have valet parking (which is part of the reason the space is limited). But self-park is free so that's fair enough. The rooms have a fridge - but it's one of those models that isn't deep so you can't put more than a few cans in it. The rooms with two beds have double beds instead of queen beds - there's a Hilton not too far away that has queens. The area is quiet - no issues with road noise. Overall it was fine.

Of the five I have stayed at this one is the best. It does not have biggest rooms as the Residence Inn and Doubletree suites are bigger. It does not have the free breakfast in basic rate like Residence inn but adding it costs like ten dollars per room or around 5 dollars per person and since I was a Marriot Silver got it for free. Three things make it the best. One it has a great bar and bartender they have food till late which was helpful when flight delayed by an hour as most places in the area stop cooking by ten. Second is the hotel in general has great facilities as their gym is a step or two above the normal gym as first time I have seen a hotel pool with a device to assist people into it. They also have a nice courtyard for large groups to hang out in and have drinks. Third is they have option to customize room as the person I am traveling with is allergic to down and they have an option when checking in for room to be feather free. The only improvement I would make is to have less fragrance pumped through hotel as many people are sensitive to that. Also though breakfast was good and up to standard of free breakfasts one gets at other hotels would have like a waffle maker or at minimum some yogurt.

We wanted to get away for an evening so we stayed only 1 night before traveling on to another city (and another Marriott hotel). The location was perfect being close to a shopping mall with many different shops and restaurants to choose from. Although we did not take advantage of shopping at the mall we did however eat at a restaurant across the street which was within walking distance...a very user friendly location. We also enjoyed having a few cocktails/beverages at the hotel lobby bar. The room was clean and due to our Marriott member level we were upgraded to a suite which was very spacious and comfortable.

The interior common areas are colorful and welcoming. (There's an outdoor courtyard but we didn't have time to enjoy it.) It's a bit like Pee Wee's Playhouse got a designer makeover. We found ourselves laughing and having a really good time. I will generally choose a Renaissance hotel if one is available and this one confirms my decision. Our room was clean and the bed was great. The staff were very nice and friendly. The bartender was quite nice and she introduced us to new local spirits. Our room service mix up was quickly remedied with many apologies. The hotel is located near lots of other entertainment and restaurant options. Once you park (which is a breeze) you can walk anywhere. I wish we could have stayed a little longer.

Apparently they have recently renovated its a beautiful hotel. The beds and linens are top of the line my grandkids even raved about them!! Some confusion with check-in and our key cards didn't work but I think our person was new. LOTS of personnel working the front counter (all women) but if you walk in wearing jeans after driving 6 hours you will feel out of place in comparison and by their "looks" toward you. (I may look frazzled ladies but my cash is going toward your wages!) These same women take your room service orders and forward them to the kitchen - what a fiasco! It took 3 phone calls and 3 trips to our room before everyone got their breakfast order and even then we were shorted on 2 settings of silverware - I didn't dare call again. Again this is a lovely hotel and if you always dress to the 9's you will be treated warmly. I would definitely stay here again (and probably wear my most rumpled outfit with uncombed hair to hear these Ivanka Trump wannabes gasp in unison as I enter their establishment.)

Great location for shopping and many wonderful restaurants within walking distance. Their are many different sizes of rooms to choose from. We stayed in a corner room that was quite nice. Larger than the side rooms. The rooms are very nicely decorated with attention paid to detail. Very clean and comfortable! The lobby is very inviting in bright colors and it opens up into a beautiful atrium with small bar. Their is also a restaurant that serves breakfast and it was very good!! We also enjoyed sitting outside in their courtyard area. Very comfortable seating trees with lights and fire pits. A great place to sit chat and have a drink.

On this trip to visit the Nascar Hall of Fame we chose to stay at the Renaissance. As soon as we got out of the car we were greeted by Danny he was so kind and helpful(EXCEPTIONAL) He went above and beyond his duties and we instantly knew that we had made the right decision. When we came in we were given champagne and instantly acknowledged by the staff. I was asked my last name and was given our room keys right away no waiting no fuss ( we were in shock) The hotel itself is very beautiful and it smells so clean. The decor is modern but does not feel cold the outside courtyard is gorgeous and very comfortable. We went up to our room and again were not dissapointed with the cleanliness. We went downstairs and again Danny was very helpful in giving us options for dinner.The next morning we decided to have breakfast at the hotel our server Larry was amazing he not only was a great server but was also very friendly with the kids. He was on top of everything the food was very good and we had a wonderful breakfast. We checked out early sunday morning sad to leave the Renaissance and Charlotte.

From the moment I arrived (5:30am from a red eye) I was greeted by the morning front door man who immediately took my baggage under control and escorted me to the front desk where the young woman checked to see if there was any way I could check in (arrival time was for the afternoon). My type of room wasn't available but they set me up with my Executive passkey and sent me into the care of the dining room manager and staff who continued the same excellent care. Later during my stay Kat took great care of me at the bar (as a wine drinker I especially appreciated their use of nice stemware and the selection of excellent wines) and Danny always made me feel like I was staying with friends rather than at a generic hotel. The salt scrub in the downstairs bathroom is just one of the excellent "extra" touches that serves to elevate this hotel.

The hotel is beautiful! Very modern and chic. The staff is very friendly and helpful couldn't ask for better service. I ate in one night and ordered room service and it was absolutely delicious. It's very close to South Park mall and all the surrounding restaraunts and bars so there is plenty to do right outside your door. With my business reservation we had access to the concierge room for breakfast and it was very good. The only complaint I have about this hotel and why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was the quality of the beds and pillows - they were very hard and uncomfortable. It is a great place to stay for business or leisure.,Rachel L,Maitland,,41 reviews,Stayed January 2014 travelled on business

On this trip to visit the Nascar Hall of Fame we chose to stay at the Renaissance. As soon as we got out of the car we were greeted by Danny he was so kind and helpful(EXCEPTIONAL) He went above and beyond his duties and we instantly knew that we had made the right decision. When we came in we were given champagne and instantly acknowledged by the staff. I was asked my last name and was given our room keys right away no waiting no fuss ( we were in shock) The hotel itself is very beautiful and it smells so clean. The decor is modern but does not feel cold the outside courtyard is gorgeous and very comfortable. We went up to our room and again were not dissapointed with the cleanliness. We went downstairs and again Danny was very helpful in giving us options for dinner.The next morning we decided to have breakfast at the hotel our server Larry was amazing he not only was a great server but was also very friendly with the kids. He was on top of everything the food was very good and we had a wonderful breakfast. We checked out early sunday morning sad to leave the Renaissance and Charlotte.

We got room service twice here and it was delicious both times. Beds were comfortable and the restroom was clean and well laid out. We had two doubles and the linens were especially soft as were the pillows. My only complaint was parking but this was in part due to the holiday season I'm sure. We had to circle a few times and wait for someone to pull out which was inconvenient with a 6 month old who was ready to get out of the car after a day of driving. It was frustrating to be turned away from an almost entirely empty lot with cones around it because we didn't want to pay for valet. Oh well we sorted it out!

We have stayed in numerous Marriott's all over the East coast. We were very impressed with the Renaissance Charlotte SouthPark. Upon arriving we were very impressed with the facility. A very beautiful Marriot. We greeted at the door by a an extremely engaging doorman. We were immediately offered a beverage and snack by the check-in staff The lobby and adjoining longue and restaurant are lovely (although we did not have the opportunity to try the restaurant so I cannot speak to the food). The check-in was seamless and the front desk staff extremely friendly. We were given a room on the 6th floor. A beautiful corner room. But...... upon sliding our keycard into the lock a problem became evident when a little dog that was in the adjacent room heard us and started yapping and yapping and yapping. Clearly nobody was in the room with the dog and it would start barking the second it heard any noise at all. Every time we moved in the room it started yapping incessantly. We quickly called down to the front desk and asked if the hotel was 'animal friendly'. The front desk attendant said it was not. We then told them about the yapping dog in the room next to us. She checked and (what a shock) the people that had checked into that room had said that they has a 'service dog' with them. We asked if it was allowed that people leave their 'service dog' in the room when they went out. The very nice girl said that it was not allowed and that they dog should have not been left alone and that she would have the manager look into it and get back to us. To be completely honest I thought that I might have been given a little lip service and the manager or someone else would call be later and tell me that their was nothing that they could do about it. Boy was I wrong. Approximately ten minutes later we heard knocking on the door of the rom with the yapping dog and the loud announcement "MANAGER". He knock and announced himself several times and then we heard the door being briefly opened and then closed and the manager walk away. It was another ten minutes before our phone rang. It was the front desk. The young girl told us that the manager had been up to the room (which we knew) and that the dog should definitely not be allowed in the room but they did not have a contact number for the people in the room and they would have to wait until they returned to "take care of it" but it would be "handled". I should mention at this juncture that during this entire time the dog hadn't stopped barking for five minutes. I told the front desk that I really didn't care what happened as long as the 'dog people' were moved. An hour later we left for a party. I stopped at the front desk. I gave her my name and immediately another young woman who I assume was a manager at some level immediately came over to me and apologized. She told me that they had locked the people out of their room so that they would have to come to the front desk upon their return. I said that I assumed that they would be moving the to another room. She said no the people would be asked to leave the hotel. WOW. We were impressed. Talk about responsive and definitive service. They run a very tight ship at the Renaissance Marriot SouthPark. We returned late that evening and sure enough no yapping dog. The next morning I asked the front desk what had happened and she very pleasantly told me that upon their return the customer was asked to leave the hotel and they did. Bet they didn't forget their 'service dog' that time. We then went to have breakfast in the concierge longue. Everyone we came in contact with at this facility was extremely friendly by the employee manning the longue had them all beat. What a nice guy. And... the breakfast the delicious as well. I would highly recommend the Marriot Renaissance SouthPark and if I am ever again in Charlotte I will definitely stay there again. One last note: There are people out there that need service animals to get through their day. They provide badly needed emotional and sometimes physical support. Many of these people are military personnel that have served our Nation proudly. It is people like the ones that left their yapping lapdog dog in the room next to us that are going to ruin it for all of those that have an actual need. These people think they are being cute and smarted than everyone else by 'conning' the system so that they can take Flopsie or Sweetie into a hotel or an airplane. They may in fact be conning the system but sooner or later their abuse of the system will result in even actual real-deal service dogs being banned. That would be a tragedy.,Kevin0454,Connecticut,,1 review,Stayed June 2014 travelled with family

Parking is free near the hotel or in it's covered garage. The hotel checkin staff were pleasant and welcomed me to the hotel. After finding out about my Marriott status she perked up even more and advised I had been upgraded to "her favorite Executive King room". The room itself was very nice. Hardwood floors a big couch and chair a huge king bed and a big closet and bathroom. The bathroom was rather small but serviceable. The hotel has a concierge lounge with some of the more pleasant hotel staff you will find. The space was big and had plenty of room to sit. Breakfast consisted of breads eggs cereal oatmeal grits sausage and bacon. The fridge had plenty of yogurt milk and water. Plenty of juice and coffee was available too. For dinner/dessert they had a variety of goodies all week. Mostly finger foods but tasty ones. Dessert varied as well with cookies and bread pudding. One evening I used the bar to have a few drinks. The bar gets pretty lively and the staff was very good. They even featured beer flights! The area has a ton of restaurants to eat including a chain tavern that the staff seemed overly pushy about.

Fully expecting the ho hum cold buffet spread- the catering far exceeded the usual hotel faire. Only other comment I would make to the hotel is after arriving later in the evening I found the hotel parking and outside to be quite dark with nothing available but a deck in the back. Due to this I opted for valet to avoid roaming around in the dark. I was glad this service was available.,nancy h,Raleigh North Carolina,,41 reviews,Stayed August 2015 travelled on business

It was our anniversary and we picked this hotel because of location and reviews. Chelsea and the rest of the reception staff were awesome and made our stay extra special. We had a few room requests that were all met and even something that was not requested but very much appreciated. Chelsea also assisted with a restaurant reservation. The hotel itself was what we expected but all of the reception staff working that afternoon/evening made the stay exceptional.

Located near many dining options. The lobby was warm and inviting. Found the room to be clean and well organized. The bathroom was a nice size and the amenities were wonderful. I had the king executive corner room. Location of room was quite. The beds were extremely comfortable. A microwave and single serve coffee maker was in the room. Complimentary Starbucks coffee was offered in the lobby every morning. The bar was a fun place to hang out after a long day of meetings. Staff very friendly. Ate in the restaurant twice nothing really to rave about normal hotel food in my option. The indoor swimming pool was nice a little small but good for a quick dip to cool off. The valet service was quick to retrieve your automobile when you needed to leave. Alan the valet was always smiling and always greeting you with a warm smile and with a good morning or good evening. Complimentary wine is served from 5-7 as well as infused water. The only thing that I did not like was that the scent coming from the air vents was a over powering which caused me to have a slight headache. Over all this is a great hotel with exceptional staff who is willing to assist you with what ever you ask. I will be staying here again when in the Charlotte area. As a matter of fact I will be staying here again mid August. I would highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure travelers alike. Thank You Renaissance for a fantasic stay.

We travel often and we've stayed at numerous Marriott properties in various states but this is absolutely one of the best we've seen to date. The outside of the property looks very nice and it's located directly across the street from South Park Mall so it has that kind of upscale feel to it. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered the building and were greeted with the nicest scent... this hotel smells really nice inside! I know that sounds like a strange comment to make for a hotel but we've stayed at many hotels in the Marriott chain that smell nice at the lobby and then smell a little musty and damp when you actually go on room floors. This one had the most pleasant smell from the time you walked in the door all the way through the hallways (even upstairs) and into the room. Very very nice way to greet your guests. The staff were wonderful and got us checked in quickly and efficiently. We were also very pleased with the room we had. We stayed in the Executive King Suite and it was very roomy for the two of us. Nice to see hardwood (laminate?) floors in a hotel room gave the place a very upscale feel. Love the Presidential Collection bathrobe in the room as well!

We have stayed in numerous Marriott's all over the East coast. We were very impressed with the Renaissance Charlotte SouthPark. Upon arriving we were very impressed with the facility. A very beautiful Marriot. We greeted at the door by a an extremely engaging doorman. We were immediately offered a beverage and snack by the check-in staff The lobby and adjoining longue and restaurant are lovely (although we did not have the opportunity to try the restaurant so I cannot speak to the food). The check-in was seamless and the front desk staff extremely friendly. We were given a room on the 6th floor. A beautiful corner room. But...... upon sliding our keycard into the lock a problem became evident when a little dog that was in the adjacent room heard us and started yapping and yapping and yapping. Clearly nobody was in the room with the dog and it would start barking the second it heard any noise at all. Every time we moved in the room it started yapping incessantly. We quickly called down to the front desk and asked if the hotel was 'animal friendly'. The front desk attendant said it was not. We then told them about the yapping dog in the room next to us. She checked and (what a shock) the people that had checked into that room had said that they has a 'service dog' with them. We asked if it was allowed that people leave their 'service dog' in the room when they went out. The very nice girl said that it was not allowed and that they dog should have not been left alone and that she would have the manager look into it and get back to us. To be completely honest I thought that I might have been given a little lip service and the manager or someone else would call be later and tell me that their was nothing that they could do about it. Boy was I wrong. Approximately ten minutes later we heard knocking on the door of the rom with the yapping dog and the loud announcement "MANAGER". He knock and announced himself several times and then we heard the door being briefly opened and then closed and the manager walk away. It was another ten minutes before our phone rang. It was the front desk. The young girl told us that the manager had been up to the room (which we knew) and that the dog should definitely not be allowed in the room but they did not have a contact number for the people in the room and they would have to wait until they returned to "take care of it" but it would be "handled". I should mention at this juncture that during this entire time the dog hadn't stopped barking for five minutes. I told the front desk that I really didn't care what happened as long as the 'dog people' were moved. An hour later we left for a party. I stopped at the front desk. I gave her my name and immediately another young woman who I assume was a manager at some level immediately came over to me and apologized. She told me that they had locked the people out of their room so that they would have to come to the front desk upon their return. I said that I assumed that they would be moving the to another room. She said no the people would be asked to leave the hotel. WOW. We were impressed. Talk about responsive and definitive service. They run a very tight ship at the Renaissance Marriot SouthPark. We returned late that evening and sure enough no yapping dog. The next morning I asked the front desk what had happened and she very pleasantly told me that upon their return the customer was asked to leave the hotel and they did. Bet they didn't forget their 'service dog' that time. We then went to have breakfast in the concierge longue. Everyone we came in contact with at this facility was extremely friendly by the employee manning the longue had them all beat. What a nice guy. And... the breakfast the delicious as well. I would highly recommend the Marriot Renaissance SouthPark and if I am ever again in Charlotte I will definitely stay there again. One last note: There are people out there that need service animals to get through their day. They provide badly needed emotional and sometimes physical support. Many of these people are military personnel that have served our Nation proudly. It is people like the ones that left their yapping lapdog dog in the room next to us that are going to ruin it for all of those that have an actual need. These people think they are being cute and smarted than everyone else by 'conning' the system so that they can take Flopsie or Sweetie into a hotel or an airplane. They may in fact be conning the system but sooner or later their abuse of the system will result in even actual real-deal service dogs being banned. That would be a tragedy.,Kevin0454,Connecticut,,1 review,Stayed June 2014 travelled with family

As we drove up to the hotel we were greeted by this enthusiastic gentleman (loved it!). Then I walked in the hotel and loved the beautiful and calm environment and was greeted by the wonderful women at the front desk. When I got to my room I was in heaven; it was exactly what I needed. In the evening I did walk to South Park mall (just about a 5 min walk) and when I came back to the hotel they had a signature I believe fruit drink that was awesome. I had a half cup and sipped and then had to ask the nice lady to fill it to the top. The next day I was greeted with Starbucks coffee downstairs in front of the convenient restaurant and I believe later in the day they had another treat out for the guests' enjoyment but I missed it beause the mall was calling my name again.

It's in a perfect location extremely safe a 20 minute drive from the airport easy drive to downtown Charlotte and walking distance to many great restaurants & the SouthPark Mall. The hotel is brimming with Southern elegance and modern decor with a comfortable & casual feel and extensive amenities making for a great stay. We heard about the amazing weekend Leisure Rate then we upgraded to the Stay-for-Breakfast deal for our Thursday night through Sunday stay. For only $10 more per night it provides a full breakfast each morning for 2 adults and 2 children age 12 & under which allows you to order off the menu or enjoy a full breakfast buffet with eggs bacon potatoes fresh fruit unlimited coffee juices yogurt bagels pastries etc plus made-to-order omelettes with full restaurant service in a pretty atrium setting. This is easily a $30 + value costing only $10 extra per night for great food & service! For couples without children who are AAA members the AAA weekend Leisure rate is also a great deal if you aren't interested in having the full breakfast at the hotel. On weekday mornings they also have a full complimentary breakfast spread in the Elite member Concierge Lounge. Our room was very clean with super comfortable beds. For parents with children you might inquire about booking one of the rooms with a balcony to enjoy relaxing or having a glass of wine overlooking the pretty indoor atrium after putting the kids to bed. For large families or groups booking multiple rooms there are plenty of nice public areas to meet and relax together in the lobby / atrium courtyard patio restaurant or bar / lounge indoor pool fitness room etc. We arrived very late from the airport on our first night and we were starving so we walked to Taco Mac a sports bar which is open until 2 a.m. and allows minors anytime at certain tables. The food was great & affordable they have 100+ beers on tap/100+ bottled plus a full bar & food menu and we were able to bring our 18 year old son and enjoy watching the Olympics on multiple big screens!

I feel like Charlotte hotels are generally quite expensive I have stayed in the Marriott and the Hampton Inn both close by. I think I actually liked this hotel the best of all three. It has a nice hip vibe without going too far. The bed was divine plush super comfortable. A nice robe to wear if you like that my friend also stayed and he had a balcony which was lovely to sit out on and have coffee in the morning. The stores close by are all great and it's a nice mall right across the road too.,Annette T,Alpharetta Georgia,,242 reviews,Stayed September 2012

Who knew that amount of beauty and atmosphere was in a hotel I pass on a weekly basis. The courtyard was lush comfortable & inviting.

It's in a perfect location extremely safe a 20 minute drive from the airport easy drive to downtown Charlotte and walking distance to many great restaurants & the SouthPark Mall. The hotel is brimming with Southern elegance and modern decor with a comfortable & casual feel and extensive amenities making for a great stay. We heard about the amazing weekend Leisure Rate then we upgraded to the Stay-for-Breakfast deal for our Thursday night through Sunday stay. For only $10 more per night it provides a full breakfast each morning for 2 adults and 2 children age 12 & under which allows you to order off the menu or enjoy a full breakfast buffet with eggs bacon potatoes fresh fruit unlimited coffee juices yogurt bagels pastries etc plus made-to-order omelettes with full restaurant service in a pretty atrium setting. This is easily a $30 + value costing only $10 extra per night for great food & service! For couples without children who are AAA members the AAA weekend Leisure rate is also a great deal if you aren't interested in having the full breakfast at the hotel. On weekday mornings they also have a full complimentary breakfast spread in the Elite member Concierge Lounge. Our room was very clean with super comfortable beds. For parents with children you might inquire about booking one of the rooms with a balcony to enjoy relaxing or having a glass of wine overlooking the pretty indoor atrium after putting the kids to bed. For large families or groups booking multiple rooms there are plenty of nice public areas to meet and relax together in the lobby / atrium courtyard patio restaurant or bar / lounge indoor pool fitness room etc. We arrived very late from the airport on our first night and we were starving so we walked to Taco Mac a sports bar which is open until 2 a.m. and allows minors anytime at certain tables.

And the toilet tank seal wasn't tight so all night the toilet ran about every five minutes. Although I thought I might get back to sleep after 2am that never happened. Room service was fine; nice to sit with feet up after a long day of shopping. I will probably try staying here again.,SingaporeLulu,Singapore,,50 reviews,Stayed December 2011 travelled solo

Hotel is modern and the staff is very friendly. Had a balcony room on the 7th floor it's nice being able to have some fresh air in the room. Very comfortable bed. The only down side of the bed were the fitted sheets that keep coming off of the top corners of the mattress. Obviously the sheets are too small for the pillow top mattresses. Wifi was abosolutely horrible. Since we are Marriott Rewards members Wifi is complimentary. Would have been upset if we paid the $12.95 a day for the sloooowwww connection. Everything is very clean and love the flavored water they offer in the lobby especially the lime with mint. Yum. In the lobby in the evening they offer complimentary drinks 1 night a glass of red wine the next mango bellini.

Was eventually told my name had been entered incorrectly while they were entering my credit card data. Main concern is made apparent being getting their money up front as due to VISA' having an IT glitch while our daily guest debit' prompted an immediate call from front desk for our third nights stay. The reservationist said they do special thing's for special occasion's. They have not done anything and this is our last nights stay for celebration of a "Mile-Stone Birthday". Also in over 25 years of extensive travels I have NEVER encountered a policy of charging 1/2 of nights stay for a mere 2 hour late check-out ... The room service has yet to deliver one meal completely correct although minor at theses prices you should expect simple condiments. Still we add additional gratuity for Server'. We also give Housekeepers gracious gratuity' . I would not recommend this hotel for leisure/special mini-getaway as they definitely haven't made my special occasion "special" ...

The location is very good with easy access to the South Park Mall and to Philips Place as well as to good restaurants like Brio George's  Del Frisco's Toscana and more. The staff is well trained and cares about customer satisfaction. The hotel has different types of comfortable rooms and rates. Due to the good offer of great restaurants in the area we did not explore very much the F&B offers of the hotel. Wireless internet connection works well and allows up to four devices per room.

I chose the hotel because based on the hotel properties in Charlotte this is one of the nicest and comes at a fair price. The decor could be thought of as tacky by some but they are going for an upscale but hip look with the color patten in the lobby areas. I was only disappointed in the room. I paid for an upgrade (club level) but it was a smaller room than I've ever had with a fair (at best view) and no club lounge (that I know of) was open.

Unfortunately it was on the 2nd floor and our view was of the roof below. The room size was just ok the decor was ok. The location is nice - in Southpark. A walk or short drive to many attractions. The bar on 12/29/12 was near empty and the drinks were just ok... they did not know how to make many drinks and don't have very many on their menu. The appetizers we got were... again just ok. Would not stay there for appetizers again and I would probably just pony up the extra $$$ and go uptown to the Ritz. But the front desk people were nice and the Valet was personal. Oh yeah.... the elevator was FREEZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! We told them and they just did not seem to care at the front desk. Upon further conversation the valet came in and said that they must not have turned on the heat. I told them it was that cold last night AND this morning.... and again no one did a thing. So... it was "ok" but NOTHING great. I might check out the regular Marriott in SouthPark before I would go back to this location. *sad* ...It has potential....

Our problem got resolved because a woman standing next to us over heard the conversation and offered to take a king room and give us her room that had two beds. She had already been in her room but was more than happy to help us. Front desk staff seemed "put out" because now they had to switch guest information between the rooms.

When I arrived at the Renaissance I was greeted by a lovely concierge (wish I could remember his name). He assisted me with parking while I went inside to check in. He made some comment about me being from Wisconsin (after noticing my license plates and EXTREMELY dirty car - hey ... roadtrips will do that to your car). He followed that comment up by letting me know that the Green Bay Packers choose to stay at the same hotel (go me!) - which was an ego boost for me as they are my FAVORITE team ever!! Plus we clearly have good taste haha. Check in was a breeze! I was at the counter for all of 5 minutes and they gave me a quick tour of the ground level. I was able to park my vehicle in the garage and unload my luggage. My only complaint - NO ELEVATOR! (I apologize if I'm wrong - but I swear I didn't see one!). Granted this is a parking garage - but I packed clothes for a week which means by women's standards there were enough clothes in there to last me a month... and I DONT work out. Just sayin! The hotel itself... now this is going to sound weird... the hotel smelled so good! I don't know what they pump into the air but I'm telling you - it's heavenly! My room was extremely clean and well kept. Shower was spacious and the bed (king size) was super comfortable. The staff was very helpful in recommending restaurants and shopping areas of interest. Noise level was minimum - the walls must be well insulated and the doors must be thick enough - or I just had the most quiet neighbors ever!

We explained that we were not interested in sharing a king size bed. They told us there was nothing they could do. Never offered to check another hotel. Our problem got resolved because a woman standing next to us over heard the conversation and offered to take a king room and give us her room that had two beds. She had already been in her room but was more than happy to help us. Front desk staff seemed "put out" because now they had to switch guest information between the rooms.

As we drove up to the hotel we were greeted by this enthusiastic gentleman (loved it!). Then I walked in the hotel and loved the beautiful and calm environment and was greeted by the wonderful women at the front desk. When I got to my room I was in heaven; it was exactly what I needed. In the evening I did walk to South Park mall (just about a 5 min walk) and when I came back to the hotel they had a signature I believe fruit drink that was awesome. I had a half cup and sipped and then had to ask the nice lady to fill it to the top. The next day I was greeted with Starbucks coffee downstairs in front of the convenient restaurant and I believe later in the day they had another treat out for the guests' enjoyment but I missed it beause the mall was calling my name again.

The entrance is very nice - lots of staff to help with bags and check in etc. The mall is across the street so that is convenient. The hallways and rooms are nicely finished. The rooms themselves are decent sized - not large but not small. The bathroom is a little cramped. It's fine for one person or two - gets tough if there are three or more. We had trouble getting the shower to work - called the desk - they were to send maintenance - but maintenance never showed up. I eventually discovered that a good whack fixed the problem. The restaurant is average. The food was just okay - prices are a little high and the seating area is in the open space which felt as little awkward since folks were waling through to to to rooms or the parking etc. There is parking in front - but not a lot of it. Once they fill up it's a bit of a hike around the hotel to get to your car. They do have valet parking (which is part of the reason the space is limited). But self-park is free so that's fair enough. The rooms have a fridge - but it's one of those models that isn't deep so you can't put more than a few cans in it. The rooms with two beds have double beds instead of queen beds - there's a Hilton not too far away that has queens. The area is quiet - no issues with road noise. Overall it was fine. I noted a few quirks but I'd stay here again.,sbccc,North Carolina,,296 reviews,Stayed March 2014 travelled with family

Our room was beautiful clean with 2 comfy queens and a sitting area. Bathroom was spotless updated and roomy enough. Not "grand" but very nice. Towels plentiful and fluffy upscale Aveda toiletries. The hotel is walking distance to the mall and a plethora of shopping and eating choices. We self parked ( no charge and convenient) and chose to drive to shopping. Valet is available. The grounds are pretty - I did not see an outdoor pool which would have been nice had the weather cooperated. The lobby and common areas offer nice seating bar and restaurant as well as seating and fire pits in the outside courtyard. Breakfast was ok - if not included in your rate there are many choices near by as alternatives. The only glitch was the maid service the first day. My daughter interrupted the service which was probably a contributing factor but the waste baskets were not emptied bathroom was not fully cleaned. I do a think this was not "typical" but expected better quality control from an upscale Marriott property. The hotel is not downtown bit if you are looking for a great location to enjoy shopping it is perfect.,where2gonexttime,boston,,85 reviews,Stayed March 2014 travelled with family

Of the five I have stayed at this one is the best. It does not have biggest rooms as the Residence Inn and Doubletree suites are bigger. It does not have the free breakfast in basic rate like Residence inn but adding it costs like ten dollars per room or around 5 dollars per person and since I was a Marriot Silver got it for free. Three things make it the best. One it has a great bar and bartender they have food till late which was helpful when flight delayed by an hour as most places in the area stop cooking by ten. Second is the hotel in general has great facilities as their gym is a step or two above the normal gym as first time I have seen a hotel pool with a device to assist people into it. They also have a nice courtyard for large groups to hang out in and have drinks. Third is they have option to customize room as the person I am traveling with is allergic to down and they have an option when checking in for room to be feather free. The only improvement I would make is to have less fragrance pumped through hotel as many people are sensitive to that. Also though breakfast was good and up to standard of free breakfasts one gets at other hotels would have like a waffle maker or at minimum some yogurt. I did like got individual juice bottle instead of just cups as allowed one to grab their drink and go. Unless something happens I will be staying here exclusively for the rest of trips to charlotte.,bccorb,New York City New York,Room Tip: Club lounge is on first floor so does not matter which floor.

He wanted to stay at the Double Tree down the street and I wanted to stay here because of the reviews about the great beds that I read here on Trip Advisor. We both needed a comfortable room to catch up on our sleep after our date. Unfortunately that was not the case here. I should have known when we walked in the room and immediately smelled a musty/mildew odor. After a while we got used to the smell and we decided not to make a big deal about it. BIG MISTAKE. After a nice evening out - dinner and a movie - we headed back to the room for some R & R. As it turns out the air conditioning unit did not work. We both woke up at 3:00 a.m. sweating from the warmth and humidity in the room. My husband even thought I had turned the heat on! It would have been better if we had been able to at least crack a window. Not an option. After messing with the air conditioner and TRYING to sleep we called the front desk two hours later. They were nice enough - apologized and gave us a $25 discount on the room and asked it we wanted to change rooms. However that was not an option as it was already 5:00 a.m. and all we wanted to do was sleep - not pack up our things again and move! We never really went back to sleep. Upon leaving we realized that even the hallway was much more comfortable than our room!!! My question is - how does the hotel staff really not know that this is a problem especially when the room smells like mildew? Obviously this has been an issue in this room for a while. While the bed was very comfortable (again a key reason why we stayed here) and the room was decorated fine we will not be staying here again. I left feeling wiped out from being awake from 3:00 on - not rejuvenated as we had hoped. I'm VERY disappointed and really wanted to like this hotel.,CharlotteReviewer,Charlotte,,48 reviews,Stayed March 2010 travelled as a couple

I should have known when we walked in the room and immediately smelled a musty/mildew odor. After a while we got used to the smell and we decided not to make a big deal about it. BIG MISTAKE. After a nice evening out - dinner and a movie - we headed back to the room for some R & R. As it turns out the air conditioning unit did not work. We both woke up at 3:00 a.m. sweating from the warmth and humidity in the room. My husband even thought I had turned the heat on! It would have been better if we had been able to at least crack a window. Not an option. After messing with the air conditioner and TRYING to sleep we called the front desk two hours later. They were nice enough - apologized and gave us a $25 discount on the room and asked it we wanted to change rooms. However that was not an option as it was already 5:00 a.m. and all we wanted to do was sleep - not pack up our things again and move! We never really went back to sleep. Upon leaving we realized that even the hallway was much more comfortable than our room!!! My question is - how does the hotel staff really not know that this is a problem especially when the room smells like mildew? Obviously this has been an issue in this room for a while. While the bed was very comfortable (again a key reason why we stayed here) and the room was decorated fine we will not be staying here again. I left feeling wiped out from being awake from 3:00 on - not rejuvenated as we had hoped.

I was worried about the bed because I am pregnant and I forgot my body pillow. The bed pillows and bedding were so comfortable that I didn't even need the body pillow. We both slept very well. The room itself was nicely decorated as well. There were limited edition prints on the walss and the furniture seemed to be updated. We had a room with a balcony over the resteraunt but we were only in town for the night so we really didn't have time to enjoy it though. It did get a bit noisy during the night being so close to the bar though. I rated the sleep comfort at 4 out of 5 rather than five because of the noise. We opted for room service for breakfast rather than eating downstairs for breakfast. The delivery was prompt but the server forgot our juice. He did bring it up right away after we pointed it out though. The check-in and check-out experience was pleasant and the staff was friendly. If I were to visit Charlotte again I would stay here again.,Mountains2Seas,Virginia,,3 reviews,Stayed March 2010 travelled as a couple

My husband and I stayed here this past weekend for a romantic get-away. The location is great as we wanted to be near great food and shopping. Our room was at the end of the hall so we were not bothered by much noise. The hotel is in need of interior updates. Dining and room service leave much to be desired. Pros: - Great location for shopping and restaurants. - The valet service was extremely courteous and efficient. - Bar tender was very pleasant. - When a second robe was requested it was delivered within minutes. - Beds are extremely comfortable. - Room furnishings were ample. Cons: - Skip the hotel breakfast. We sat for 10 minutes before a server acknowledged us and took our drink order. I passed on the mediocre looking buffet and opted for a made to order omelet. I was given the wrong omelet and the server never checked back with us. Even though we purchased breakfast for two days with our room we skipped it the second day. - Furnishing in the bar need replaced. All of the bar stools were scratched up and felt like they were about to fall apart. - The second morning of our stay we opted for coffee juice and bagels in our room. We placed our breakfast card on the door at 11 PM (cut-off is 2 AM) and no one picked it up. However someone did make a point of dropping off our bill. When my husband went downstairs to get some coffee he heard another guest complaining about the exact same thing. Apparently the person responsible for picking up breakfast cards was a no-show. I would think that the person who dropped off the bills would have noticed the oversight and communicated to management that breakfast cards were not picked up. If it wasn't for the poor breakfast and in-room dining service I probably would have rated my experience as Very Good.

This place is the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in. The best beds BY FAR. I just couldn't get over it. I had to sort of learn how to do this hotel. Check in was smooth. They were able to give us adjoining rooms. One had two queen beds and one had a great king....the rooms were more than adequately sized and very comfortable. The decor is odd but very comfortable and I like bright colors (good thing). Great big screen HD TV's and all the electronic stuff to go with it...also internet access etc. Very nice bath with premium towels. Coffee in room but under cabinet....plenty of electrical outlets. Wall Street Journals in the lobby and USA Today in the elevator landings. The fitness area was supurb and again immaculate. Initially I was a little put off by the restaurant. We were all going down for breakfast and I thought to myself that it was way overpriced...so we went to the Original Waffle House down the street a little (excellent really). I reviewed it a little more though and it was really more how the menu was presented not nearly as bad as I thought at first. I also didn't understand how they could charge ($1.50) for a cup of coffee (I sort of was looking for a cup very early without wanting to go in....) but I broke down and got one and considering all the value I was getting elsewhere it was OK. We did go in for breakfast eventually and it was reasonable as long as you shopped the menu a little and the Chef was on scene and was very concerned we were happy. We order continental breakfast and it was extensive...again more the I expected and a delight. Perfectly located across from the deluxe Southpark Mall. (Nordstrom etc) LOTS of restaurants close by. Parking mystified me a little at first but there is a parking garage adjoining the hotel in the rear very convenient. My son lost his phone and we didn't realize it until after we left. We went back to get it....and thinking they wouldn't try hard enough to find it I went upstairs on my own initiative...the head of housekeeping and the room attendent were down on the floor on their hands and knees looking for it.

Some minor inconvenience is accessing the the service counter is the result. Staff were friendly and welcoming. The mall across the street is high end and worth a look. Many restaurants within the immediate area you can walk to. On our first morning my wife woke up and noticed a "big bug" on the wall. It was a cockroach! (We took pictures. Weren't sure they would believe us.) Being from Canada we don't get much opportunity to see them nor become familiar with how fast they are. Tried twice to capture it with a plastic bag but it ran under the bed. We packed up our suitcases headed down to the service desk and were promptly given a room on another floor. (We were told they are referred to a Palmetto bugs down south and the clerk had never had an incident with them since she has been there.)

First thing i noticed that we were taken to a side entrance with a white canopy I expected some minor construction must be going on. You walk in and check in resturants bar are all in what appears to be suites converted. You quickly realize that the entire place is under construction except the rooms!! We had our meetings in the Queens Court we had to walk through a flimsy wooden door to get to this area. Everyone was complaining that we paid way to much for our "negotiated"conference rate for the condition of the hotel. I would definately agree. The room though i would say if very nice. I have no complaints. Loved how clean it was. Loved how well lit the bathroom was...a rarity in hotel bathrooms. The pillows were standard unconfortable hotel pillows but the bed was quite comfy. The hotel was a ghost town rarely saw other people parking lot was empty. There was a little town center type area within walking distance that had shops and eateries was nice. Had a great meal at an Italian Steakhouse. I think it was called Brio 120 or something like that. Didn't really pay attention...the food and company were more important. I would definiately stay here again if it wasn't under construction and if there were no hilton's available (my first hotel of choice when it's my decision for business travel).,iaexplorer,Council Bluffs,,11 reviews,Stayed July 2010 travelled on business

This place is the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in. The best beds BY FAR. I just couldn't get over it. I had to sort of learn how to do this hotel. Check in was smooth. They were able to give us adjoining rooms. One had two queen beds and one had a great king....the rooms were more than adequately sized and very comfortable. The decor is odd but very comfortable and I like bright colors (good thing). Great big screen HD TV's and all the electronic stuff to go with it...also internet access etc. Very nice bath with premium towels. Coffee in room but under cabinet....plenty of electrical outlets. Wall Street Journals in the lobby and USA Today in the elevator landings. The fitness area was supurb and again immaculate. Initially I was a little put off by the restaurant. We were all going down for breakfast and I thought to myself that it was way overpriced...so we went to the Original Waffle House down the street a little (excellent really). I reviewed it a little more though and it was really more how the menu was presented not nearly as bad as I thought at first. I also didn't understand how they could charge ($1.50) for a cup of coffee (I sort of was looking for a cup very early without wanting to go in....) but I broke down and got one and considering all the value I was getting elsewhere it was OK. We did go in for breakfast eventually and it was reasonable as long as you shopped the menu a little and the Chef was on scene and was very concerned we were happy. We order continental breakfast and it was extensive...again more the I expected and a delight. Perfectly located across from the deluxe Southpark Mall. (Nordstrom etc) LOTS of restaurants close by. Parking mystified me a little at first but there is a parking garage adjoining the hotel in the rear very convenient. My son lost his phone and we didn't realize it until after we left. We went back to get it....and thinking they wouldn't try hard enough to find it I went upstairs on my own initiative...the head of housekeeping and the room attendent were down on the floor on their hands and knees looking for it. Way above the call of duty and I think this is the way the whole place is run.,BobWFlorida,Florida,,9 reviews,Stayed June 2009 travelled with family

However they put us in a balcony overlooking the waterfall and lounge area which was romantic since it was our anniversary. They have valet parking but there is ample parking all around the hotel plus a deck. The breakfast buffet was actually very good plentiful great mini-waffles made fresh for you.

It is a beautiful property in a super nice South Park location. The upscale South Park Mall is nearby and there are several good restaurants in the area. We were met by Danny at the door the first day and he was so helpful all three days we stayed in the hotel. He is most definitely an asset to this hotel....friendly and fun! The front desk staff was always helpful and gave us several good recommendations for restaurants. Everyone is very very friendly greeting each guest passing through the front lobby. The other doormen we met were also very helpful and we felt pampered! The room we had (601) had a not-so-great view of the parking deck but it was very quiet. Room decor is contemporary bright colors....I guess you could say a 'happy look'. Bedding is very comfortable and you get a robe (we had to ask for an extra one) just like at the JW Marriotts. Bath products are by Aveda and smell wonderful! There is a mini fridge and a coffee maker hair dryer and a magnifying mirror (yay!). Rooms were very clean and housekeeping came promptly and made up the room each day. We were given plenty of towels during the three days there. We paid extra for the concierge floor package which included free breakfast in the club room and internet. The breakfasts were actually pretty nice....eggs breads lots of fresh fruit oatmeal juice and brewed Starbucks coffee. There were often snacks in the lobby and one day we had champagne and delicious chocolates! Parking is free and that is definitely a plus over the downtown hotels in Charlotte. I would say it's worth it to pay a little more to have the free internet and club lounge breakfasts.

The check in experience was good and my breakfast room service was punctual and the food was fresh and tasty..had eggs hash browns. bacon and blueberry muffins. The overall hotel layout and decor is inviting. While the mall is close by and the neighborhood is fine not too crazy about the hotel location. Usually like hotels in large cities to be a bit closer to livelier scenery.

Front desk staff gave excellent advice for dinner restaurant choices as well as pointing out other attractions that were nearby. The hotel was quiet and my breakfast was included in the concierge lounge. The buffet had plenty of choices and was quite tasty.

This is a very classy hotel in a great location. I've stayed at various hotels downtown and would easily opt for this property over any of those. The staff are incredibly engaged and helpful. I do feel the rate is a bit high over $300 for this stay. That will make it cost prohibitive for me next time. The free parking helps.

The decor and furnishings are modern and unique. Each day the lobby features a small portion snack such as candied pecans crudite with hummus or fried pickles topped with pimento. The unique snack is accompanied by a signature beverage and infused water. This hotel was a very relaxing space to spend three days of intense business meetings.

We went to this hotel for 2 weekends back to back.. First stay was ok .. The room was ok .. Beds comfy defiantly needed a good cleaning .. Just over looked the whole stay ... I get home and I had forgotten my fit bit in the room .. I called as soon as I got home .... I called and left 3 messages for the manager of housekeeping ... I still have not heard back from him.. Ok so after calling and asking the front desk about my loss they still transfer me to the manager of housekeeping ... He still has not called me back .. All I want is an answer do they have my fit bit??? Yes or no... So a lady in housekeeping Jessie called me back all I asked was where is my fit bit I really could not understand what the big deal is .. Just call me back .. Ok so I just checked out today .. Face to face conversation where is my fit bit ??? They look at each other and still the answer is that they really have not looked till today ... I showed the lady a photo of what we are missing ... I really try my hardest to be positive about my stay .. I am loyal to this hotel when in the area.. I am only wanting a straight answer .... The whole stay was off ...

We went to this hotel for 2 weekends back to back.. First stay was ok .. The room was ok .. Beds comfy defiantly needed a good cleaning .. Just over looked the whole stay ... I get home and I had forgotten my fit bit in the room .. I called as soon as I got home .... I called and left 3 messages for the manager of housekeeping ... I still have not heard back from him.. Ok so after calling and asking the front desk about my loss they still transfer me to the manager of housekeeping ... He still has not called me back .. All I want is an answer do they have my fit bit??? Yes or no... So a lady in housekeeping Jessie called me back all I asked was where is my fit bit I really could not understand what the big deal is .. Just call me back .. Ok so I just checked out today .. Face to face conversation where is my fit bit ??? They look at each other and still the answer is that they really have not looked till today ... I showed the lady a photo of what we are missing ... I really try my hardest to be positive about my stay .. I am loyal to this hotel when in the area.. I am only wanting a straight answer .... The whole stay was off ...

The location near shopping and restaurants is fabulous and the hotel is a very satisfactory choice for a weekend in Charlotte. This time we were in a corner king room which was spacious comfortable and quiet. The common areas of the hotel are very open which gives it an energetic feel that I don't find particularly appealing but with all of the wonderful things nearby to experience this isn't a hotel you'd spend the day hanging around the lobby in anyway. All in all a great choice and I'm confident we will choose it again on our next trip to Charlotte.,pickyaboutwhereistay,Lynchburg Virginia,Room Tip: corner king rooms are spacious and quite See more room tips,11 reviews,Stayed January 2016 travelled with family

(There are two other hotels closer but this one turned out to be fine even though we did have to drive across the street and find a place to park. That area is not pedestrian friendly.) The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful and the check in was quick and easy. Our room was fairly large with two queen extremely comfortable beds with duvets and down pillows. The bathroom was large enough for two and the shower had a very nice waterfall showerhead. There were plenty of fluffy towels and lots of toiletries and they gladly gave us toothpaste when we realized we had forgotten ours. I was excited to find a lighted magnifying mirror in the bathroom but it was too close to the side wall so it ended up being fairly unusable. Besides the mirror in the bathroom there was only another one in the hallway (closet door) with no outlet nearby which made it difficult for two women in the bathroom trying to dry straighten and curl their hair. As with almost every hotel I have ever stayed in there are not enough reachable outlets for hair appliances or the many electronics (phones cameras iPods laptops) that have to be charged at night. Also the level of lighting is on the dim side and for those of us of middle age and older this can make reading difficult. One thing that was noticeably missing was information on area restaurants. The only info we could find was about the hotel restaurant. One other minus was the level of noise from the hall. People talking while walking down the hall sounded like they could be in the room with us. It didn't bother me because I always travel with earplugs! Overall the stay while short was very comfortable and pleasant.

Marriott is my preference and of all Marriott properties I've ever stayed at (I'm a Gold Elite member at present) this one is the most wonderful. We ended up here because we were appalled by the Marriott Courtyard downtown when we arrived so we jumped in a cab and headed here. Boy we couldn't have been happier about that decision. $60 cheaper a night and worth three times more. First the renovations of the rooms are now complete so the previous reviewer's issue with renovations should be history. And as this is a family-owned Marriott (ie not a franchise) the renovation has spared no expense or attention to detail. In short the rooms are utterly gorgeous. And beds that put the normal (yet wonderful) Marriott Revive bedding package to shame - it was like sleeping on air. Very modern selection for colour scheme and the rooms were completely quiet - I didn't hear a single sound despite the property being at almost full occupancy. The concierge lounge is not yet renovated (although the plans look spectacular!) so they were offering free buffet breakfast to Gold Elite members in the restaurant instead. The buffet was not amongst the more lavish of the Marriott spreads but it was still very nice with fresh omelettes made to order and a decent selection of accompaniments - bacon sausage potatoes fruit baked goods cereal....and of course the always present JW Marriott oatmeal! The location is not downtown - it's about a $25-30 cab ride into the city. But it's directly across the street from a very large shopping mall (South Park Mall) with department and specialty stores ranging from high end (Neiman Marcus Louis Vuitton) through to the normal mall fare (Dillards Macy's Gap Brookstone). There's also a Rite Aid within five minutes' walking distance so I felt the location catered particularly well for visitors both with and without cars. The staff and service - without exception (and we dealt with almost all of them during the four days of our stay) were second-to-none and that's saying something for Marriott where the standard is generally quite high. My colleague and I both commented that we'd never felt more welcome or "at home" at any hotel and we travel more than 120 nights a year around the world. We will be coming to Charlotte on a reasonably regular basis and cannot wait to return to this hotel. One word of caution: The restaurant and concierge lounge are being renovated between now and the end of the year so if this is an issue for you defer your stay until January 2009. But personally it wouldn't cause me a moment's hesitation - this place is pure gold. Enjoy!,antipodienne,Australia,,26 reviews,Stayed November 2008 travelled on business

I accompanied my husband to Charlotte and while he was taking care of busy I just wanted to be able to relax at a nice place and walk to shopping or grab a bite if I wanted (being that I was on foot patrol :-) hubby had the car). As we drove up to the hotel we were greeted by this enthusiastic gentleman (loved it!). Then I walked in the hotel and loved the beautiful and calm environment and was greeted by the wonderful women at the front desk. When I got to my room I was in heaven; it was exactly what I needed. In the evening I did walk to South Park mall (just about a 5 min walk) and when I came back to the hotel they had a signature I believe fruit drink that was awesome. I had a half cup and sipped and then had to ask the nice lady to fill it to the top. The next day I was greeted with Starbucks coffee downstairs in front of the convenient restaurant and I believe later in the day they had another treat out for the guests' enjoyment but I missed it beause the mall was calling my name again. I just wanted to thank all the personnel at his hotel for an incredible stay.,rosekerr2002,charlotte,,4 reviews,Stayed September 2015 travelled with family

I have always been partial to Renaissance hotels and this one did not disappoint! Myself and 3 girlfriends traveled to Charlotte from the DC area for a girls weekend and the Janet Jackson concert. We booked two rooms but wanted adjoining which was no problem. Upon arrival the hotel was beautiful. Soon as we walked in we were greeted with a glass of wine and some chocolate desserts. YUMMY! The rooms were beautiful and very spacious. One afternoon we bought some wine and just sat in the lobby's sucken living room space for hours it was so comfy. There were wedding receptions going on so we got to see all the wedding parties in their finest. And the area...just perfect. Close to tons of restaurants and shopping.

From the moment I arrived (5:30am from a red eye) I was greeted by the morning front door man who immediately took my baggage under control and escorted me to the front desk where the young woman checked to see if there was any way I could check in (arrival time was for the afternoon). My type of room wasn't available but they set me up with my Executive passkey and sent me into the care of the dining room manager and staff who continued the same excellent care. Later during my stay Kat took great care of me at the bar (as a wine drinker I especially appreciated their use of nice stemware and the selection of excellent wines) and Danny always made me feel like I was staying with friends rather than at a generic hotel. The salt scrub in the downstairs bathroom is just one of the excellent "extra" touches that serves to elevate this hotel.

I was greeted the moment I walked in and was checked in quickly offered a glass of wine and then given a brief tour guided to the elevator. That extra step upon check in was really above and beyond. My room was very spacious everything was clean and modern and the bed was heavenly. The mall is across the street and you are surrounded with other restaurants and shopping near by as well. I requested room service for breakfast and it was prompt at the time requested and the meal was good. The second evening instead of wine there were chocolates and champagne in the lobby which really sold me on the hotel. I also had a chance to stop by the bar and the staff was very friendly and the service was prompt. This was a great stay and if I can sneak away from family I will definitely stay here again. I appreciate the attention to small details that were shown by the staff those things make this hotel stand apart.,TravelingButterflyy,DC,,35 reviews,Stayed January 2014 travelled solo

Our room was beautiful clean with 2 comfy queens and a sitting area. Bathroom was spotless updated and roomy enough. Not "grand" but very nice. Towels plentiful and fluffy upscale Aveda toiletries. The hotel is walking distance to the mall and a plethora of shopping and eating choices. We self parked ( no charge and convenient) and chose to drive to shopping. Valet is available. The grounds are pretty - I did not see an outdoor pool which would have been nice had the weather cooperated. The lobby and common areas offer nice seating bar and restaurant as well as seating and fire pits in the outside courtyard. Breakfast was ok - if not included in your rate there are many choices near by as alternatives. The only glitch was the maid service the first day. My daughter interrupted the service which was probably a contributing factor but the waste baskets were not emptied bathroom was not fully cleaned. I do a think this was not "typical" but expected better quality control from an upscale Marriott property. The hotel is not downtown bit if you are looking for a great location to enjoy shopping it is perfect.,where2gonexttime,boston,,85 reviews,Stayed March 2014 travelled with family

Of the five I have stayed at this one is the best. It does not have biggest rooms as the Residence Inn and Doubletree suites are bigger. It does not have the free breakfast in basic rate like Residence inn but adding it costs like ten dollars per room or around 5 dollars per person and since I was a Marriot Silver got it for free. Three things make it the best. One it has a great bar and bartender they have food till late which was helpful when flight delayed by an hour as most places in the area stop cooking by ten. Second is the hotel in general has great facilities as their gym is a step or two above the normal gym as first time I have seen a hotel pool with a device to assist people into it. They also have a nice courtyard for large groups to hang out in and have drinks. Third is they have option to customize room as the person I am traveling with is allergic to down and they have an option when checking in for room to be feather free. The only improvement I would make is to have less fragrance pumped through hotel as many people are sensitive to that. Also though breakfast was good and up to standard of free breakfasts one gets at other hotels would have like a waffle maker or at minimum some yogurt.

The lobby is very inviting in bright colors and it opens up into a beautiful atrium with small bar. Their is also a restaurant that serves breakfast and it was very good!! We also enjoyed sitting outside in their courtyard area. Very comfortable seating trees with lights and fire pits. A great place to sit chat and have a drink.

I am a very frequent business traveler and maintain silver elite status with them. They told me that as I had prepaid they were not "able" to change it and the money I spent was forfeited - even though they had plenty of space. Simple remedy booked with DoubleTree next door that has a much more flexible change/cancellation policy.

The lobby and common areas are a very interesting mix of modern/70s style and the original rough stone flooring etc. -- very different -- still not sure if if we liked it or not. The hotel offered several nice amenities such as drinks and snacks for a happy hour free in the lobby and the staff was very friendly. The bar area was also very nice and reasonably priced. Our biggest issue would be with the cleanliness. The bathroom didn't appear clean -- still had hair on the floor and in the tub -- after cleaning.,incarolina,Charlotte,,53 reviews,Stayed December 2013 travelled as a couple

I was greeted the moment I walked in and was checked in quickly offered a glass of wine and then given a brief tour guided to the elevator. That extra step upon check in was really above and beyond. My room was very spacious everything was clean and modern and the bed was heavenly. The mall is across the street and you are surrounded with other restaurants and shopping near by as well. I requested room service for breakfast and it was prompt at the time requested and the meal was good. The second evening instead of wine there were chocolates and champagne in the lobby which really sold me on the hotel. I also had a chance to stop by the bar and the staff was very friendly and the service was prompt. This was a great stay and if I can sneak away from family I will definitely stay here again.

It was the hotel notifying me that my car was broken into! Upon arriving at the scene in the parking deck attached to the hotel I learned that 3 other vehicles had also been broken into. While I appreciated one of the manager's assistance with the police vacuuming the shattered glass out of my car and covering the passenger door so I could drive my vehicle I did not appreciate the reminders my wife and I received that the hotel wasn't responsible because there were signs posted (you know the standard disclaimer signs you see in almost every parking deck). Nor did I appreciate their failure to offer anything as a token of their empathy for what happened...I'm sure corporate told them not to. Unfortunately the hotel has limited outdoor parking so the parking deck was the only parking option other than valet. After receiving an initial call by someone in Marriott's investigations department a couple days later and not receiving any further update after emailing him I responded to the Marriott survey of my stay. I gave a poor review but suggested that they could take a few simple steps to better deter that type of thing such as install cameras and verbally warn guests. Within an hour or two I received a response from the hotel manager apologizing for the incident and again reminding me that signs were posted...as though it were my fault for choosing to park in the attached parking deck rather than use valet! By her tone and message it seems clear that they absolve themselves of any responsibilities and will not be taking any further actions to safeguard their guests' vehicles. I let her know that and have not received any further response. So be aware!!! Do NOT park in the parking deck!!!

The overall look and feel of the hotel exterior and interior is very nice and appealing. All the staff from the doorman to the clerk at the check-in counter and others were very friendly welcoming and hospitable. The doorman pointed me to a very nice local restaurant within walking distance and hit it out of the park with his recommendation. He even followed up with me when he next saw me to ask about the experience there. The hotel employees really embody the southern hospitality thing and it was appreciate by yours truly. The room was spacious and comfortable with a nice sized desk for my laptop and cell and a comfortable lounging chair to kick back in and read. The bed was very comfortable and I had a good night's sleep. The room had a small fridge microwave and a single cup coffee maker. Like many hotels however they really need to install more wall outlets. It's somewhat tacky for a high-end hotel to have guests reaching behind furniture to unplug the microwave so they can plug in the coffee maker. The room had a small balcony enough for two people to sit out on. Mine was over the atrium so it was nice for people watching. But if there was a convention or large group at the hotel it would add to the noise factor I'm sure. My only beefs: 1- charging for wireless access?! Really? Seriously? I think even Motel 6 offers free wi-fi guys. This smells of nickel and diming. For the price you charge to stay I think free wi-fi should be part of the package. The DAILY charge for basic wi-fi is $13 and if you want high-speed for streaming purposes it's another $2 over that. Kinda tacky folks. Left a small bad taste over what would have otherwise been a very good customer experience. 2- charging $17.99 for the movie that I pay DirecTV $5.99 for? Again this just smells of gouging a customer to me. Despite the two negative customer experience examples above I would still stay here again if I needed to be in this proximity. I might not go out of my way to stay here however.,EdGooding,Montpelier Virginia,,18 reviews,Stayed June 2014 travelled on business

By her tone and message it seems clear that they absolve themselves of any responsibilities and will not be taking any further actions to safeguard their guests' vehicles. I let her know that and have not received any further response. So be aware!!! Do NOT park in the parking deck!!! I will not be staying there when I return to Charlotte.,DavidQ6390BL,Richmond Virginia,,1 review,Stayed June 2014 travelled as a couple

The overall look and feel of the hotel exterior and interior is very nice and appealing. All the staff from the doorman to the clerk at the check-in counter and others were very friendly welcoming and hospitable. The doorman pointed me to a very nice local restaurant within walking distance and hit it out of the park with his recommendation. He even followed up with me when he next saw me to ask about the experience there. The hotel employees really embody the southern hospitality thing and it was appreciate by yours truly. The room was spacious and comfortable with a nice sized desk for my laptop and cell and a comfortable lounging chair to kick back in and read. The bed was very comfortable and I had a good night's sleep. The room had a small fridge microwave and a single cup coffee maker. Like many hotels however they really need to install more wall outlets. It's somewhat tacky for a high-end hotel to have guests reaching behind furniture to unplug the microwave so they can plug in the coffee maker. The room had a small balcony enough for two people to sit out on. Mine was over the atrium so it was nice for people watching. But if there was a convention or large group at the hotel it would add to the noise factor I'm sure. My only beefs: 1- charging for wireless access?! Really? Seriously? I think even Motel 6 offers free wi-fi guys. This smells of nickel and diming. For the price you charge to stay I think free wi-fi should be part of the package. The DAILY charge for basic wi-fi is $13 and if you want high-speed for streaming purposes it's another $2 over that. Kinda tacky folks. Left a small bad taste over what would have otherwise been a very good customer experience. 2- charging $17.99 for the movie that I pay DirecTV $5.99 for? Again this just smells of gouging a customer to me. Despite the two negative customer experience examples above I would still stay here again if I needed to be in this proximity. I might not go out of my way to stay here however.,EdGooding,Montpelier Virginia,,18 reviews,Stayed June 2014 travelled on business

This hotel lived up to its brand from location to accommodation. The curb appeal for this hotel is awesome. Driving up you already feel that you are going to have a great experience. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. They referred to me and my husband as Mr and Mrs. Given that it was my wedding Anniversary was a welcomed jester. The lobby was very festive and welcoming. We entered to the sounds of jazz and laughter. It made us want to immediately drop our bags off and visit the restaurant/bar. The food in the restaurant was very good and I am a foodie. The drinks at the bar was even better. The room was very comfortable and spacious. South Park Mall an upscale Mall is walking distance from the hotel. Also it is very close to many restaurants. Great hotel for groups traveling to Charlotte with different budgets given that the Courtyard by Marriott and the Residence Inn are both walking distance from this hotel. Highly recommended for Special occasions and leisure travel to Charlotte.,MCTTRAVEL57,Atlanta Georgia,,44 reviews,Stayed May 2014 travelled as a couple

We have stayed in numerous Marriott's all over the East coast. We were very impressed with the Renaissance Charlotte SouthPark. Upon arriving we were very impressed with the facility. A very beautiful Marriot. We greeted at the door by a an extremely engaging doorman. We were immediately offered a beverage and snack by the check-in staff The lobby and adjoining longue and restaurant are lovely (although we did not have the opportunity to try the restaurant so I cannot speak to the food). The check-in was seamless and the front desk staff extremely friendly. We were given a room on the 6th floor. A beautiful corner room. But...... upon sliding our keycard into the lock a problem became evident when a little dog that was in the adjacent room heard us and started yapping and yapping and yapping. Clearly nobody was in the room with the dog and it would start barking the second it heard any noise at all. Every time we moved in the room it started yapping incessantly. We quickly called down to the front desk and asked if the hotel was 'animal friendly'. The front desk attendant said it was not. We then told them about the yapping dog in the room next to us. She checked and (what a shock) the people that had checked into that room had said that they has a 'service dog' with them. We asked if it was allowed that people leave their 'service dog' in the room when they went out. The very nice girl said that it was not allowed and that they dog should have not been left alone and that she would have the manager look into it and get back to us. To be completely honest I thought that I might have been given a little lip service and the manager or someone else would call be later and tell me that their was nothing that they could do about it. Boy was I wrong. Approximately ten minutes later we heard knocking on the door of the rom with the yapping dog and the loud announcement "MANAGER". He knock and announced himself several times and then we heard the door being briefly opened and then closed and the manager walk away. It was another ten minutes before our phone rang. It was the front desk. The young girl told us that the manager had been up to the room (which we knew) and that the dog should definitely not be allowed in the room but they did not have a contact number for the people in the room and they would have to wait until they returned to "take care of it" but it would be "handled". I should mention at this juncture that during this entire time the dog hadn't stopped barking for five minutes. I told the front desk that I really didn't care what happened as long as the 'dog people' were moved. An hour later we left for a party. I stopped at the front desk. I gave her my name and immediately another young woman who I assume was a manager at some level immediately came over to me and apologized. She told me that they had locked the people out of their room so that they would have to come to the front desk upon their return. I said that I assumed that they would be moving the to another room. She said no the people would be asked to leave the hotel. WOW. We were impressed. Talk about responsive and definitive service. They run a very tight ship at the Renaissance Marriot SouthPark. We returned late that evening and sure enough no yapping dog. The next morning I asked the front desk what had happened and she very pleasantly told me that upon their return the customer was asked to leave the hotel and they did. Bet they didn't forget their 'service dog' that time. We then went to have breakfast in the concierge longue. Everyone we came in contact with at this facility was extremely friendly by the employee manning the longue had them all beat. What a nice guy. And... the breakfast the delicious as well. I would highly recommend the Marriot Renaissance SouthPark and if I am ever again in Charlotte I will definitely stay there again. One last note: There are people out there that need service animals to get through their day. They provide badly needed emotional and sometimes physical support. Many of these people are military personnel that have served our Nation proudly. It is people like the ones that left their yapping lapdog dog in the room next to us that are going to ruin it for all of those that have an actual need. These people think they are being cute and smarted than everyone else by 'conning' the system so that they can take Flopsie or Sweetie into a hotel or an airplane. They may in fact be conning the system but sooner or later their abuse of the system will result in even actual real-deal service dogs being banned. That would be a tragedy.,Kevin0454,Connecticut,,1 review,Stayed June 2014 travelled with family

It was the hotel notifying me that my car was broken into! Upon arriving at the scene in the parking deck attached to the hotel I learned that 3 other vehicles had also been broken into. While I appreciated one of the manager's assistance with the police vacuuming the shattered glass out of my car and covering the passenger door so I could drive my vehicle I did not appreciate the reminders my wife and I received that the hotel wasn't responsible because there were signs posted (you know the standard disclaimer signs you see in almost every parking deck). Nor did I appreciate their failure to offer anything as a token of their empathy for what happened...I'm sure corporate told them not to. Unfortunately the hotel has limited outdoor parking so the parking deck was the only parking option other than valet. After receiving an initial call by someone in Marriott's investigations department a couple days later and not receiving any further update after emailing him I responded to the Marriott survey of my stay. I gave a poor review but suggested that they could take a few simple steps to better deter that type of thing such as install cameras and verbally warn guests. Within an hour or two I received a response from the hotel manager apologizing for the incident and again reminding me that signs were posted...as though it were my fault for choosing to park in the attached parking deck rather than use valet!

The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Our granddaughters loved the pool. Our room was roomy but the bed was not very comfortable. The mattress pad fit poorly so it had a tendency to come off when you roll over in bed. The bellman Danny was wonderful. He greeted us warmly each time he saw us and was especially nice to our young granddaughters.,Melanie H,Cazy West Virginia United States,,88 reviews,Stayed June 2014 travelled on business

We have stayed in numerous Marriott's all over the East coast. We were very impressed with the Renaissance Charlotte SouthPark. Upon arriving we were very impressed with the facility. A very beautiful Marriot. We greeted at the door by a an extremely engaging doorman. We were immediately offered a beverage and snack by the check-in staff The lobby and adjoining longue and restaurant are lovely (although we did not have the opportunity to try the restaurant so I cannot speak to the food). The check-in was seamless and the front desk staff extremely friendly. We were given a room on the 6th floor. A beautiful corner room. But...... upon sliding our keycard into the lock a problem became evident when a little dog that was in the adjacent room heard us and started yapping and yapping and yapping. Clearly nobody was in the room with the dog and it would start barking the second it heard any noise at all. Every time we moved in the room it started yapping incessantly. We quickly called down to the front desk and asked if the hotel was 'animal friendly'. The front desk attendant said it was not. We then told them about the yapping dog in the room next to us. She checked and (what a shock) the people that had checked into that room had said that they has a 'service dog' with them. We asked if it was allowed that people leave their 'service dog' in the room when they went out. The very nice girl said that it was not allowed and that they dog should have not been left alone and that she would have the manager look into it and get back to us. To be completely honest I thought that I might have been given a little lip service and the manager or someone else would call be later and tell me that their was nothing that they could do about it. Boy was I wrong. Approximately ten minutes later we heard knocking on the door of the rom with the yapping dog and the loud announcement "MANAGER". He knock and announced himself several times and then we heard the door being briefly opened and then closed and the manager walk away. It was another ten minutes before our phone rang. It was the front desk. The young girl told us that the manager had been up to the room (which we knew) and that the dog should definitely not be allowed in the room but they did not have a contact number for the people in the room and they would have to wait until they returned to "take care of it" but it would be "handled". I should mention at this juncture that during this entire time the dog hadn't stopped barking for five minutes. I told the front desk that I really didn't care what happened as long as the 'dog people' were moved. An hour later we left for a party. I stopped at the front desk. I gave her my name and immediately another young woman who I assume was a manager at some level immediately came over to me and apologized. She told me that they had locked the people out of their room so that they would have to come to the front desk upon their return. I said that I assumed that they would be moving the to another room. She said no the people would be asked to leave the hotel. WOW. We were impressed. Talk about responsive and definitive service. They run a very tight ship at the Renaissance Marriot SouthPark. We returned late that evening and sure enough no yapping dog. The next morning I asked the front desk what had happened and she very pleasantly told me that upon their return the customer was asked to leave the hotel and they did. Bet they didn't forget their 'service dog' that time. We then went to have breakfast in the concierge longue. Everyone we came in contact with at this facility was extremely friendly by the employee manning the longue had them all beat. What a nice guy. And... the breakfast the delicious as well. I would highly recommend the Marriot Renaissance SouthPark and if I am ever again in Charlotte I will definitely stay there again. One last note: There are people out there that need service animals to get through their day. They provide badly needed emotional and sometimes physical support. Many of these people are military personnel that have served our Nation proudly. It is people like the ones that left their yapping lapdog dog in the room next to us that are going to ruin it for all of those that have an actual need. These people think they are being cute and smarted than everyone else by 'conning' the system so that they can take Flopsie or Sweetie into a hotel or an airplane. They may in fact be conning the system but sooner or later their abuse of the system will result in even actual real-deal service dogs being banned. That would be a tragedy.,Kevin0454,Connecticut,,1 review,Stayed June 2014 travelled with family

The staff was very friendly throughout our stay. We don't normally use bellman services but decided to use Alan due to his very friendly nature. He remembered us by name throughout our 5-night stay and assisted with restaurant recommendations area attractions and other helpful information. Every business needs an "Alan" as a face of the business. Our room was very nice and clean with a small refrigerator that helped with two teenagers on the trip. The hotel has a laundry room with free detergent and fabric softener. There are many good restaurants within walking and driving distance with a mall across the street with food court. My wife and kids visited Carowinds amusement park while I was attending a training. They enjoyed the park with several roller coasters for the teenagers and a water park. It is 8-10 miles away at the NC/SC border off I-77. We would definitely stay at the Renaissance again if returning to Charlotte. Thank you again Alan for starting our stay on a great note and continuing your friendliness throughout our stay!,Not-Taking-My-Guns,Dublin Georgia,,30 reviews,Stayed June 2014 travelled on business

Hands down this is the best hotel to stay at in South Park. The service here is some of the best I ever had from the front desk bar and especially my favorite person at the hotel... the door man/bell man DANNY!!! He is the most positive person I've ever come across in the hotel industry. I travel about every week for my job and I always look forward to coming to Charlotte to stay and see Danny. After a long business day at the office he is a breath of fresh air with his positive & upbeat energy. I know that many others would agree with me that have stayed at this location. Make sure that if you have the opportunity to stay in South Park that you make a point to stay at the Renaissance South Park and enjoy the company of chatting with Danny when you arrive or come in from a long work day on the road.,Nicole H,Knoxville Tennessee,,1 review,Stayed September 2014 travelled on business

It was our anniversary and we picked this hotel because of location and reviews. Chelsea and the rest of the reception staff were awesome and made our stay extra special. We had a few room requests that were all met and even something that was not requested but very much appreciated. Chelsea also assisted with a restaurant reservation. The hotel itself was what we expected but all of the reception staff working that afternoon/evening made the stay exceptional.
